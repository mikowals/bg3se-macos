## [v0.44.0] - 2026-09-15 — First release on 4.1.1.7398727: PR integration, live verification, StaticData banks, toolchain probe

**Category:** Release / Correctness / Tests | **Plan:** docs/plans/2026-09-14-001-chore-pr-issue-triage-v0430-plan.md | **PRs:** #101, #103 (@mikowals) | **Verified on:** BG3 4.1.1.7398727 (arm64 LC_UUID `0C51CAED-6D60-3DCD-9299-8519C92631B0`)

v0.44.0 is the first release since v0.39.0 (2026-04-24). It ships everything in the four dated sections below (2026-08-02 through 2026-09-15): the offline offset migration to 7398727, the Wave 7 Phase 1 dual-VM work, the #101/#103 integration, and the Phase 5/6 live-verification fixes.

### Fixed

- **PersistentVars saved as `null`** (`src/lua/lua_persistentvars.c`) — the
  table index was taken with `lua_gettop()` after `luaL_buffinit()`, which
  pushes a placeholder in Lua 5.4, so the serializer received the placeholder.
  Every mod's saved variables were written as four bytes. (#101, @mikowals)
- **`Ext.Enums.X[n]` always nil** (`src/enum/enum_ext.c`) — `lua_isstring()`
  swallowed integer keys before the integer branch ran. (#101, @mikowals)
  Extended to the same ordering in `enum_lua.c` (`__eq`) and `bitfield_lua.c`
  (bitwise operands): `AttributeFlags[0x2] | 0x4` now works, `'4'` is still
  rejected.
- **ARM64 safe hook installed at target+4** (`src/hooks/arm64_decode.c`) —
  `arm64_analyze_prologue()` prefers offset 0 when the 16-byte entry window has
  no PC-relative instruction; a later `bl` no longer pushes the hook past the
  frame push. The live consumer whose offset moves is the `GetFreeMessage` net
  hook. (#101, @mikowals)
- **Osiris wrappers discarded x0** (`src/injector/main.c`,
  `src/osiris/osiris_types.h`) — `fake_InitGame` and `fake_Event` return
  `uint64_t` and forward the original's result; a void wrapper let trailing
  code decide the engine's story-init status. (#101, @mikowals)
- **`Ext.Json.Stringify(proxy)` returned `"null"`** (`src/lua/lua_json.c`) —
  userdata with `__pairs` (component and entity proxies) now serializes in
  place as an object through the existing depth cap (200). Reworked from the
  #101 materialize pre-pass, which cloned every table and capped at depth 32.
  New active-path cycle guard: `t.self = t` emits `{"self":null}`, and a
  branching cycle no longer expands exponentially. A raising `__pairs` is
  logged and yields `null` for that node without aborting the call. `_D()`
  dumps proxies through the same path.

- **SpellMeta stride was 80, engine uses 96** (`src/entity/component_offsets.h`)
  — `SpellContainer.Spells[n]` for n ≥ 2 pointed 16·(n−1) bytes short of the
  real entry. Live-read on 4.1.1.7398727: consecutive `SpellId` FixedStrings at
  +0x00, +0x60, +0xC0, +0x120 and a byte-identical 0x60 record. The
  mageweaver fork's 0x60 claim was correct. Array elements now also expose
  `SpellId`. (#102 fork triage)
- **`entity.Uuid` resolved to nil** (`src/entity/generated_component_registry.c`,
  generator `tools/extract_typeids.py`) — generated TypeId discovery never
  copied the discovered index into the hand-written layout, so every layout
  whose component is only in the generated list kept `componentTypeIndex 0`
  (`ls::uuid::Component` discovered as 2082, layout 0). The generated path now
  mirrors the curated one.
- **Component GUID fields came out byte-reversed** (`src/entity/component_property.c`)
  — `FIELD_TYPE_GUID`, `ELEM_TYPE_GUID` and the ClassInfo `ClassUUID`/
  `SubClassUUID` formatters printed the 16 bytes in memory order, so
  `entity.Uuid.EntityUuid` read `831cd0b4-e925-…` for the host whose canonical
  id is `b4d01c83-25e9-…` and never matched `HandleToUuid()` or the Osiris
  GUID. All property GUIDs now go through `guid_to_string()` (the same routine
  `Ext.Entity.HandleToUuid` uses).
- **`Transform.Translate` was nil, `Position` read the quaternion**
  (`src/entity/entity_system.h`, `entity_system.c`) — the legacy
  `TransformComponent` struct put position first, but the raw component on
  7398727 holds the quaternion at +0x00, translation at +0x10 and scale at
  +0x1c (Windows `ls::Transform` order). Struct reordered; the Lua table now
  carries `Translate`/`RotationQuat` (Windows names) alongside the legacy
  `Position`/`Rotation` keys.
- **`Ext.Entity.GetAllEntitiesWithUuid()` returned `{}`** (`src/entity/entity_system.c`)
  — the walk required `Keys.size == Values.size`, but `Values` is an
  `UninitializedStaticArray` sized to the key capacity (live: 23,151 keys,
  32,768 values), so the guard rejected every non-full map. Now walks the live
  key count and only requires the value storage to cover it. The tier-2
  `Wave7.Entity.GetEntitiesAroundPosition` zero-radius call also indexed the
  `{x,y,z}` position table by integer; fixed.

### Review follow-ups (Codex gpt-5.6-sol, three adversarial passes on the integration diff)

- **PersistentVars save runs under a protected call**
  (`src/lua/lua_persistentvars.c`) — the periodic save is entered from the
  native Osiris tick with no Lua frame above it; a `__pairs` callback that
  mutated the table under `lua_next` ("invalid key to 'next'"), a mod table
  `__index` metamethod, or a `luaL_Buffer` allocation failure would have
  longjmp'd through the game. The worker now runs via `lua_pcall`, reads
  `PersistentVars` raw, and `persist_save_all()` returns whether every write
  succeeded. A failed write keeps the dirty flag (retry at the save interval)
  and `Ext.Vars.SyncPersistentVars()` returns the real status instead of
  `true`.
- **JSON serializer reserves stack per level** (`src/lua/lua_json.c`) — each
  recursion level parks up to five values; 200 levels exceed `LUA_MINSTACK`.
  `lua_checkstack()` per table/userdata level, fail-soft to `null`. Non-string
  error objects (`error({code=1})`) are logged by type instead of passing a
  NULL to `%s`.
- **ARM64 dirty entry windows fail closed** (`src/hooks/arm64_decode.c`,
  `arm64_decode.h`) — a PC-relative instruction inside the four-instruction
  patch window now yields `safe_hook_offset = -1` (no relocation exists, so the
  forward skip re-ran an unrelocated ADRP/branch in the trampoline). `TBNZ` is
  now recognised (the 0x7F mask matched only `TBZ`). Closes #106. No live hook
  changes: `GetFreeMessage` and `FeatManager::GetFeats` both have clean entry
  windows on 7398727.
- **Bitfields reject bits outside the type mask** (`src/enum/enum_ext.c`,
  `src/enum/bitfield_lua.c`) — `AttributeFlags[0x800000]`, `AttributeFlags[-1]`
  and `flags | 0x800000` are nil/error rather than userdata carrying undefined
  bits.
- **Tier-0 fixtures** — PersistentVars setup captures HOME before anything can
  fail and publishes the temp tree only after the redirect; `mod_paths`
  asserts the terminator before `strcmp`; pattern-scan and safe-memory comment
  corrections.

### Added (Phase 6, 2026-09-15)

- **`Ext.StaticData` type `CharacterCreationAppearanceVisual`** (#100) —
  `eoc::CharacterCreationAppearanceVisualManager` is captured through the
  existing TypeContext name match (`src/staticdata/staticdata_manager.c`), and
  entries expose the Windows property surface through a new data-driven layout
  table (`src/staticdata/staticdata_layouts.c`): `RootTemplate`, `RaceUUID`,
  `BodyType`, `BodyShape`, `SlotName`, `VisualResource`, `HeadAppearanceUUID`,
  `DefaultSkinColor`, `DisplayName` (TranslatedString as
  `{Handle={Handle,Version}, ArgumentString={…}}`), `IconIdOverride`,
  `DefaultForBodyType`, `TextureEntryPart`, `Tags` (GUID array). Unreadable
  fields are omitted, never faked. BG3SX's `SessionLoaded` handler no longer
  aborts on the unknown-type error. Tier 0 audits every layout (ascending,
  aligned, inside the stride); tier 2 checks count, fields, and the
  `RaceUUID → Race` and `Get(type, ResourceUUID)` round trips live.
- **Configure-time Objective-C++ toolchain probe** (#77, #88) —
  `CMakeLists.txt` compiles `<tuple>` + `<MetalKit/MetalKit.h>` before any
  target is generated and fails with `xcode-select -p`, `xcrun --show-sdk-path`,
  `CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT`, the compiler, and where `<tuple>` was found, plus the
  three fixes in likelihood order. `-DBG3SE_SKIP_TOOLCHAIN_PROBE=ON` bypasses
  it. The July reply on #88 credited SDK auto-detection (`720d067`, 2026-03-31)
  as the fix; it predates the report and was not.
- **`bg3se-harness doctor` toolchain checks** (#88) — five new warning-level
  rows: `toolchain_developer_dir`, `toolchain_macos_sdk`,
  `toolchain_objcxx_compiler`, `toolchain_objcxx_includes` (the same include
  chain as the CMake probe, compiled against the SDK xcrun reports), and
  `toolchain_cmake`. Missing tools and timeouts degrade to readable failures.
  `docs/harness.md` previously claimed `doctor` verified the SDK; it did not.

### Fixed (Phase 6, 2026-09-15)

- **`Ext.StaticData.GetAll()` returned empty or garbage entries for most types**
  (`src/staticdata/staticdata_manager.c`) — the TypeContext "manager" pointer
  the accessors dereferenced is the type's `m_TypeIndex` global, not a
  resource bank (`eoc::FeatManager` slot ↔ unslid `0x108927c30`, the `nm`
  address of `ls::TypeId<…>::m_TypeIndex`), so `+0x7C`/`+0x80` read
  neighbouring globals: `Feat` count 0, `Class` count 24576. Only
  `ActionResource` (Get<T> hook) had real entries, and its 0x80 stride was
  also wrong. Every type now resolves its `GuidResourceBank<T>` through the
  headmaster hash table at post-init and lazily on access, entries come from
  the bank's flat `Values` array, and the stride is measured live from the
  entry vtable repeat (Race 0x168, Background 0x70, Class 0x110,
  ActionResource 0x60, FeatDescription 0x60 on 7398727; a stale constant is
  logged and overridden). The Feat-only accessor duplicates and the metadata
  probing helpers are gone. `ghidra/offsets/STATICDATA_MANAGERS.md` revised.
- **`Ext.StaticData` GUID text was pair-swapped in the last two groups**
  (`src/staticdata/staticdata_manager.c`) — `ResourceUUID` was formatted, and
  `Get(type, guid)` parsed, in memory order, but `ls::Guid` stores the D and E
  groups with adjacent byte pairs swapped. Canonical GUIDs from the game's
  `.lsx` files (Human race `0eb594cb-8820-4be6-a58d-8be7a1a98fba`) never
  matched. Both directions now use the entity system's `guid_parse()` /
  `guid_to_string()` (Phase 5 verified against the host character). Same
  defect class as the component-GUID fix above.

### Changed

- **Tier 0: 68 → 141 tests.** Phase 6 adds 4 StaticData layout audits (tier H 361 → 368 with the doctor toolchain suite; tier 2 110 → 114). #103 adds 23 mutation-hardening cases
  (safe_memory, mod_paths, pattern_scan, entity_events); #101 adds 22 across
  five new suites; the integration pass adds 15 (JSON cycles/depth/fail-soft,
  enum operands); the review follow-ups add 9 (callback-count and
  rewind-across-realloc proofs, shared-proxy siblings, table→proxy cycle,
  numeric-key golden, direct stack balance on every failure path, protected
  save, raw mod-table read, failed-write dirty retention, bitfield mask, every
  PC-relative form at every window index). PersistentVars fixture is hermetic
  (HOME restored, no `system()`).
- **`tests/harness/test_typeid_generation.py`** passes again: the frozen-binary
  test passed `report`/`build_id` positionally after `system_types` was added
  to `generate_header()`, and the committed generated files are regenerated
  with the 7209685 → 7398727 migration report they were supposed to carry.

### Documentation

- Codex review reports for #91, #101, #103 and the issue triage under
  `docs/reviews/2026-09-14-codex/`. Draft maintainer comments alongside.

## [v0.44.0] - 2026-08-04 (later) — Offset re-migration to 4.1.1.7398727 (offline complete)

**Category:** Migration / RE | **Plan:** docs/plans/2026-08-04-001-feat-offset-remigration-7398727-plan.md

### Added

- **7398727 offset row** (`src/core/offset_table.c`) — every singleton and
  function re-derived from exact arm64 nm on the frozen binary; the two
  anonymous slots (`global_switches_ptr` 0x108b25f40, `osiris_interface_ptr`
  0x108ab68f8) recovered by ADRP+LDR metathesis with old-build self-test
  (`ghidra/offsets/ADDRESS_MIGRATION_7398727.md`).
- **GameFunctionId interface** — typed per-version `game_functions[]` replaces
  the two-column remap; `component_data_shift_valid` guard (six distinct
  TypeId deltas killed the scalar-shift model).
- **TypeId regeneration for 7398727** — 2,004 components per exact mangled
  symbol; ReplicatedTypeContext globals generated and consumed by
  `replication_flags.c`.
- **`Ext.Stats.GetValueListRegistryDiagnostic()`** — bounded read-only
  registry walk (validity, manager, count, ≤8 names) so Phase 5 can prove the
  read path before any insertion.
- **New offset-table fields** `status_proto_mgr_ptr`, `passives_ptr`,
  `interrupt_proto_mgr_ptr`, `boost_proto_mgr_ptr`, `baseapp_instance_ptr` —
  `prototype_managers.c` and `focus_hack.c` no longer hardcode build-specific
  VAs (the focus hack *writes* through its pointer; a stale slot was a
  memory-corruption hazard).

### Fixed

- **July enum-registry regression root-caused**: `RPGSTATS_OFFSET_MODIFIER_VALUE_LISTS`
  was `0x08`, double-counting the manager vtable — `RPGStats::Destroy` disasm on
  both builds proves the ValueList manager sits at `+0x00`
  (`ghidra/offsets/VALUELIST_REGISTRY_7398727.md`). Registry reads now validate
  `count ≤ capacity ≤ 4096`.
- **`HandleToUuid` GUID byte-order** — formatter rewritten as the exact inverse
  of `guid_parse`; tier0 regression suite added (68/68).

### Gates (evidence-driven, per ABI_REVIEW_7398727.md — all six subsystems PASS statically)

- **Moved to 7398727**: `BG3_KNOWN_VERSION`, sentinels,
  `FUNCTOR_ADDRS_VERIFIED_BUILD`, `COMPONENT_OPS_VERIFIED_BUILD`.
- **Kept closed**: ECS system update (system-TypeId table still 7209685),
  savegame hook (E1.1 proof pending), RaycastAny UUID (stress ladder pending),
  ValueList Insert (new dedicated `VALUELIST_INSERT_VERIFIED_BUILD` — no live
  insert has ever succeeded on any build).

### Validation

- Build clean; Tier 0 **68/68**; harness pytest **288 passed, 0 xfailed** —
  including live-disasm confirmation of the Osiris slot on the installed
  binary. Live tiers (`!test`, `!test_ingame`) await the Phase 5 session.

## [v0.44.0] - 2026-08-04 — Live verification session + game update to 4.1.1.7398727

**Category:** Verification / Truth pass | **Evidence:** docs/parity-100/LIVE-VERIFICATION-2026-08-04.md

### Verified (live, build 7209685 — the final session on that build)

- **Tier 1: 113/114, Tier 2: 104/110.** All Wave 5 targets passed:
  `Wave7.Entity.GetReplicationFlags`, `Wave7.Level.RaycastAny` (through **real
  VMT-slot-10 dispatch** — LC_UUID + version gates provably open),
  `Wave7.Entity.OnSystemUpdate`, `Parity.Level.GetHeightsAt.*` (×3),
  `Diagnostic.Level.TileRawDebugInfo`, `Wave7.Osi.DBDelete`. No parity credit
  moves: the GetReplicationFlags live-probe checklist and the RaycastAny stress
  ladder remain outstanding — both stay `behavioral_gap`.

### Fixed

- **Stale Tier-1 test** `Stats.Goal23.HonestSurface` — asserted the pre-B1
  `AddEnumerationValue == nil` contract; now asserts unknown-enum fail-closed
  (`false`) without touching a real enum.
- **Over-strict Tier-2 test** `Parity.Level.SweepCylinderAll` — now accepts the
  legitimate no-hit `nil` like its `Closest` companion.
- **`version.h` lag** — `BG3SE_VERSION` bumped 0.42.0 → 0.43.0 to match the
  documented release.

### Discovered (real defects, filed as follow-ups)

- **`HandleToUuid` emits the engine-internal swizzled GUID byte order**
  (`UuidToHandle` is correct) — fails `Wave7.Entity.UuidRoundtrip` and
  `GetAllEntitiesWithUuid`.
- **Enum/ValueList registry resolution is broken live** — every enum name
  resolves NULL (read and write paths) despite an open version gate;
  contradicts the B1 "live-verified" record, suspect the 2026-07-28 migration
  missed the value-list root. Fails `Wave7.Stats.AddEnumerationValue`.
- **Host component-proxy nil reads** (`Transform`, `Uuid`) — downstream failure
  of `Wave7.Entity.GetEntitiesAroundPosition`.

### Changed (environment)

- **Steam updated BG3 to 4.1.1.7398727** (arm64 LC_UUID
  `0C51CAED-6D60-3DCD-9299-8519C92631B0`) at 01:36 EDT, wiping the injection
  patch. All 68 `test_offset_audit.py` tests now fail **by design** and every
  runtime version/UUID gate fails closed until offsets are re-migrated
  (metathesis plan, `docs/plans/2026-05-13-003`).

## [v0.44.0] - 2026-08-02 — Wave 7 Phase 1 (E2.0–E2.2): dual-VM state ownership

**Category:** Architecture / Dual-VM foundation | **Plan:** docs/plans/2026-08-01-001-feat-wave-7-terminal-parity-plan.md

### Added

- **`LuaRuntime` ownership registry** (`src/lua/lua_runtime.c/h`) — client and
  server Lua VMs are now owned objects `{ _Atomic(lua_State *) L, context,
  generation, alive }` resolved via `lua_runtime_state_for(ctx)`; generations
  bump on unregister so references to a dead state are recognizably stale.
  The single-VM fallback is compatibility-only: the first client registration
  latches dual-VM mode, after which a dead exact-context runtime resolves to
  NULL instead of routing callbacks into the other VM's registry.
- **Script-empty client VM (E2.2)** — `init_lua` creates and registers a second
  Lua state behind the same `lua_gate` with standard libraries and a minimal
  Ext surface (IsServer/IsClient/GetContext/Print). All mod code stays in the
  server VM until E2.3 splits bootstraps; `shutdown_lua` retires client-first.
- **Static ownership gate** (`tests/harness/test_lua_state_ownership.py`) —
  CI fails on any new file-scope `lua_State` declaration outside
  `lua_runtime.[ch]`; the audited allowlist is empty and must stay empty.
- **E2.0 state-ownership audit** (`docs/dual-vm/E2.0-state-ownership-audit.md`)
  — 36-item inventory across 7 categories with per-item dispositions;
  Category 1 (raw `lua_State*` caches) fully migrated.
- **10 new tier-0 tests** (65 total): dual-context reporting, coroutine
  main-thread resolution, generation bumps, double-register refusal,
  pre/post-latch `state_for` semantics, repeated dual init/shutdown balance,
  and register/unregister no-op guards (NULL state, already-dead runtime).

### Changed

- **All eight raw `lua_State*` caches deleted** — main.c's global `L`, IMGUI,
  hotkeys, CGEventTap input, console, entity events, functor hooks, and the
  log callback now resolve through the runtime registry (post-gate for Lua
  entry, atomic pre-check for liveness). IMGUI and hotkey dispatch stay
  pinned to the bootstrap (server) VM until E2.3 — their refs live there.
- **Module dispatch barriers** — entity events, functor hooks, and the log
  callback each gained an atomic dispatch-enabled flag cleared FIRST in their
  shutdown paths, preserving the old null-the-cache-first teardown ordering
  (Dobby hooks stay patched; logging threads can hold callback snapshots).
- **`Ext.IsServer/IsClient/GetContext`** — a client-VM caller reports CLIENT by
  fixed runtime identity; the server VM keeps the bootstrap phase global until
  E2.3 (mods see unchanged behavior).
- **GCD console poll timer** re-resolves the server runtime each tick instead
  of capturing init-time state (stale-capture fix across shutdown/re-init).
- **`imgui_test` tool** registers its standalone state as the server runtime
  (matching where `lua_imgui_cleanup_refs` resolves refs until E2.3;
  registering CLIENT would latch dual mode with no server and leak refs).
- **Review fix pass** (four-lens: correctness, silent-failure, tests, docs) —
  `entity_events_cleanup` is now wired into `shutdown_lua` (CCR signal hooks
  removed, Lua refs released, dispatch gate dropped — it was previously never
  called); `functor_hooks_shutdown` no longer NULLs the original-function
  pointers, so permanently-patched Dobby wrappers keep forwarding to the game
  post-shutdown instead of silently no-oping stat functors; refused
  re-registration in `lua_runtime_register` and a dead server runtime in the
  console poll each warn once instead of failing silently.

### Verification

- Offline gates: tier0 65/65, pytest harness 254/254. Live (build 7209685):
  Tier1 113/113, Tier2 94/96 — identical to the v0.42.0 baseline (both misses
  are the documented environment-dependent probes).
- **Full compat matrix, 2026-08-02**: all 11 manifested scenarios passed every
  step (mcm 27/27, community_library 25/25, combat_extender 27/27, 5e_spells
  23/23, transmog_enhanced 21/21, …) with `compat diff` reporting zero
  regressions against `docs/compat-reports/baseline/` for all 11. Each
  scenario is a full launch/quit cycle of the dual-VM dylib with the client
  VM registered. The 3 failures in the 18-entry roster are `mod_check`
  pre-flights on uninstalled catalog-only entries (bg3_mod_fixer,
  configurable_enemies, improved_ui) — inventory conditions, not SE behavior.

## [v0.43.0] - 2026-08-03 — Wave 7 A/B-series

**Category:** Entity / Stats / Types / Net / Osiris | **Parity:** pending live-verification recomputation | **Issues:** Wave 7 A1/A3/A4/A5/A6/A7/B1/B2/B6

### Added

- **A1 — five `Ext.Entity` registrations** — `HandleToUuid`, `UuidToHandle`,
  `GetAllEntitiesWithUuid`, `GetRegisteredComponentTypes` (including
  `mapped`/`oneFrame` filters), and `GetEntitiesAroundPosition` are behavioral.
  Entity registration parity moves from 14/26 to **19/26 (73.1%)**.
- **A5 — `Osi.DB_*:Delete(...)`** — exact-match row deletion through
  `CReteDBase::erase`, followed by `ForwardDelToken` RETE propagation. Symbols
  resolve from `libOsiris.dylib` exports. Exact-arity errors match Windows;
  neither platform supports wildcards, and deleting a missing row is a no-op.
  Tier-2 `Wave7.Osi.DBDelete` covers arity errors, nil rejection, and no-op
  invariance. Destructive deletion is live-verified manually.
- **B1 — `Ext.Stats.AddEnumerationValue`** — implemented through engine
  `ValueList::Insert` at `0x101c44920`. Runtime labels use the existing
  engine-backed `fixed_string_intern()` path. The call succeeds only when
  forward label-to-index and reverse index-to-label readback agree and the
  count grows exactly once. Duplicate labels and unknown enums return false.
- **B3 — `Ext.Level.GetTileRawDebugInfo(x, z)`** — raw tile diagnostic surface
  (no parity credit): native `AiFlags` word, raw ground/cloud mask bytes, and
  world-space Min/MaxHeight. `AiGridTile::MinHeight` at `+0x0a` is **confirmed**
  via two independent accessor sites (`ToClosestTilePos`, `ToTilePos`) sharing
  the `/50` scaling; reads are tear-checked double-reads through the verified
  subgrid map with static asserts pinning the layout.
- **B5 — `Ext.Types.GetHashSetValueAt`** — full implementation against the
  proven `ls::HashSet` layout with the Windows 1-based contract
  (Types.inl:310-318). No current surface produces a live HashSet proxy, so the
  function validates its type-tagged userdata argument and rejects everything
  else deterministically; the metatable reserves the contract for the future
  FIELD_TYPE_HASHSET component-property surface.
- **B6 — `Ext.Entity.OnSystemUpdate` / `OnSystemPostUpdate`** — named ECS
  system-update subscriptions via the writable `SystemTypeEntry::UpdateProc`
  registry (entry `+0x18`, stride `0xf8` — `ECS_SYSTEM_UPDATE_RECON.md`). The
  replacement installs only on first subscribe, verifies the original pointer
  lies inside executable `__TEXT`, always calls the original, and restores it on
  last unsubscribe, world transition, and teardown. All 73 Windows
  `ExtSystemType` names mapped; callbacks run under the Lua gate with
  runtime-resolved state. Unsupported builds fail closed. Live firing remains
  pending in-game verification.
- **C step 2 — `entity:GetReplicationFlags(component[,qword])`** — a real
  **read-only** method on the entity proxy (matching the Windows placement,
  `LuaEntityProxy.inl:415`), replacing the former `Ext.Entity` warn-and-nil
  namespace stub (which was a macOS-only invention Windows never had). It
  traverses the CONFIRMED SyncBuffers → HashMap → DynamicBitSet chain
  (`REPLICATION_SYNCBUFFERS.md`) with fully guarded reads and no mutation
  (`src/entity/replication_flags.c`), resolving the 9 confirmed replicated-type
  globals; version-gated and fail-closed. Earns **no parity credit** until the
  live-probe checklist validates the runtime int32 indices in-game (step 2 of
  the 9-step Phase C plan).
- **B4b — `Ext.Level.RaycastAny`** — the zeroed by-value
  `ls::Optional<PhysicsSceneScopedReadLock&>` ABI is proven GO
  (`RAYCAST_ABI_B4A.md`), and a real binding now dispatches physics VMT slot 10,
  selecting the worker's internal `lockRead → raycast → unlockRead` path
  (`src/level/level_manager.c`, `src/lua/lua_level.c`). It is arm64-only and
  fail-closed unless BOTH `version_detect_matches()` and the audited Mach-O UUID
  match. The prior quarantined warn-once stub and its `Parity.Level.RaycastAnyDeferred`
  test are retired. Ships with **no parity credit** until the live stress ladder
  (no-hit / one / multiple / mask-exclusion / thousands-of-calls / level reload)
  passes; Ext.Level stays **20/25**.
- **Wave 7 test coverage** — the measured suite is now **114 Tier 1** and
  **110 Tier 2**. B/C-series adds Tier-1 `Parity.Types.CustomProps` and
  `Parity.Types.GetHashSetValueAt` (upgraded from an existence check to the
  full validation contract) plus Tier-2 `Wave7.Osi.DBDelete`,
  `Wave7.Stats.AddEnumerationValue`, `Wave7.Entity.Tracing`,
  `Wave7.Entity.OnSystemUpdate`, `Diagnostic.Level.TileRawDebugInfo`,
  `Wave7.Entity.GetReplicationFlags`, and `Wave7.Level.RaycastAny` (net +1 after
  retiring `Parity.Level.RaycastAnyDeferred`). A new Tier-H guard
  (`test_raycast_any_binding_is_gated`) asserts the RaycastAny binding dispatches
  VMT slot 10 and is arch+UUID+version gated. The four-tier total is **544**: 65
  Tier 0, 255 pytest, 114 Tier 1, and 110 Tier 2.

### Changed

- **A3 — `Ext.Types.Construct` exact Windows error surface** — invalid calls
  now raise `Unknown type name '%s'`,
  `Unable to construct non-object type '%s'`, or
  `Type '%s' is not constructible`. Object types pass all checks and reach the
  same upstream TODO at Types.inl:286-302, returning 0 values. The contract is
  matched upstream and remains outside the scored denominator.
- **A4 — `Ext.Stats.Get(name, level)` adjudicated as matched upstream** —
  Windows Stats.inl:479-508 also ignores `level`, calling
  `StatFindObject(statName, warnOnError)` by name only. The docstring is a DOS2
  vestige; macOS behavior was already at parity, so no code change was needed.
- **A6 — `Ext.Net.PlayerHasExtender(guid)`** — the GUID branch now resolves a
  peer through `peer_manager_find_by_guid`. Unknown characters and unassigned
  users return nil; assigned peers return
  `peer_manager_can_send_extender`, matching ServerNet.inl:78-86.
- **Truth correction + fix — `Ext.Level.GetHeightsAt` made real** — Wave 7 B3
  exposed that the binding routed through a stub
  (`src/level/level_manager.c:1636`) that always returned an empty table,
  despite the manifest and docs listing it as engine-backed. The same day, the
  real multi-subgrid walk landed matching Windows Ai.inl:262/406 exactly:
  half-open subgrid bounds, `floor((world - origin) / CellSize)` tile mapping,
  blocker-skip (flags bit 0), and `Translate.y + MaxHeight/50` heights only.
  All required offsets CONFIRMED by static disasm (Translate.x/y/z at
  `+0x08/+0x0c/+0x10`, CellSize `+0x14` = 0.5f, encoded world bounds
  `+0x40..+0x4c` — AIGRID_PATHFINDING.md). Reads are tear-checked and
  fail-closed; the old four-height cap is gone. Ext.Level stays **20/25
  (80%)**; Tier-2 `Parity.Level.GetHeightsAt.*` (3 tests) covers host
  non-empty, tile-range cross-check, and out-of-bounds.
- **Contract manifest** — `AddEnumerationValue` moves from behavioral gap to
  implemented. Tallies are now 210 implemented, 70 behavioral gaps, 1 matched
  upstream TODO, and 13 excluded across 294 contracts: **75.0% function-level
  behavioral parity**.

### Technical

- **A1 spatial-query backend** — `GetEntitiesAroundPosition` honors the
  Windows 2D XZ-circle contract: Y is ignored and `includeCharacters` /
  `includeItems` default true. It walks
  `eoc::character::CharacterComponent` and the item marker component, then
  reads `ls::TransformComponent`, because the ARM64 spatial-grid
  `GridStructure` layout remains unrecovered. Full contract behavior is met.
- **A7 — FLOAT_ARRAY component writer** — mirrors INT32_ARRAY with exact-length
  validation, NaN/Inf rejection, a staged buffer, and atomic commit. It earns
  no parity credit yet: the only candidate field,
  `ls::EffectComponent::OverrideFadeCapacity`, has unverified ARM64 offsets
  because the Ghidra bridge was down.
- **B2 — passive sync reconstruction** — `Passives::Parse` requires no
  loader-private state, but only resolves names to existing prototypes.
  Existing-entry scalar/description refresh and all three functor-list
  refreshes are statically safe. `Boosts` remains blocked on an LTO closure
  ABI. The map chain is decoded as a `0x220` node containing an inline `0x210`
  prototype. Verdict: PARTIAL-GO for a five-step future milestone;
  `sync_passive_prototype()` remains false. Evidence:
  `ghidra/offsets/PASSIVES_PARSE_RECON.md`.
- **B6 — ECS system-update reconstruction** — `ExecuteWTKernel` dispatches
  through the swappable `SystemTypeEntry::UpdateProc` at `+0x18`; entries have
  stride `0xf8`, and the `EntityWorld` array/buffer are at `+0x28`/`+0x30`.
  The central executor at `0x1063788cc` is a diagnostic fallback. Verdict:
  implementation-ready; `OnSystemUpdate` and `OnSystemPostUpdate` remain
  behavioral gaps until the separate implementation lands. Evidence:
  `ghidra/offsets/ECS_SYSTEM_UPDATE_RECON.md`.

## [v0.42.0] - 2026-08-01 — Wave 6: Final Audit — truth pass, native prototype getters, parity re-baseline

**Category:** Truth pass / Release | **Parity:** ~94.8% (behavioral accounting, per-function contract diffs) | **Issues:** docs/parity-100/ synthesis

### Added

- **Native cached prototype lookups** — `Ext.Stats.GetCachedPassive` and
  `GetCachedInterrupt` now dispatch through the engine's own getters instead
  of the generic RefMap walk: `InterruptPrototypeManager::GetPrototype`
  (`0x101b7adcc`; x1 = FixedString const*, returns `&values[index]`, stride
  0x1f0) and `eoc::Passives::Get` (`0x101c0f27c`). The passive getter is
  **LTO arg-promoted** — despite the `const&` in its mangled name, w1 carries
  the FixedString index by value (instruction-verified; full disassembly in
  `ghidra/offsets/COMPONENT_OPS_AND_PROTO_INIT.md`). This fixes a latent bug:
  interrupt storage is a hash table over a contiguous 0x1f0-stride array, and
  `eoc::Passives` stores prototypes inline in chained nodes — the old
  values-are-pointers read returned interior garbage for both. Both offsets
  live in the per-version offset table with nm-audited migration recipes
  (`tools/offset_manifest.json`); unknown game versions fail closed with a
  warn-once. Live-verified: interrupt prototype's FixedString at +0x0
  round-trips the name; unknown names miss to nil.
- **Tier-2 test `Stats.W6.NativeCachedLookups`** (96 in-game tests).
- **Wave 7 contract manifest** (`docs/parity-100/CONTRACT.md` + machine-readable
  `contract.json`) — all 293 Windows-registered contracts inventoried from the
  registration blocks and proxy metatables (module functions, entity/stats
  proxy methods, per-context Client/Server modules) with zero unclassified
  entries: 202 implemented, 77 behavioral gaps, 1 matched upstream TODO,
  13 excluded = **72.4% function-level behavioral parity**. This is the Wave 7
  scoring denominator. New `bg3se-harness parity scan --contract` mode scores
  against it offline; 7 new pytest guards pin the verified per-namespace
  counts (Entity 14/26, Types 10/13, Net gap = PlayerHasExtender GUID path).
  516 tests total (55 C + 252 pytest + 113 Tier 1 + 96 Tier 2).
- **ROADMAP stale-item adjudication** — every unchecked/pending marker
  classified: 17 verified complete (evidence cited inline), 4 annotated to
  Wave 7 phases, 8 marked obsolete. Nothing remains silently stale.

### Changed

- **Parity re-baselined to ~94.8% with behavioral accounting and per-function
  contract diffs** — rows are scored against the Windows registration blocks
  with admitted fail-closed stubs scoring zero and macOS-only extras earning
  no credit: Ext.Entity 53.8% (14/26 of Entity.inl:291-325 behavioral — 11
  registrations missing outright: HandleToUuid, UuidToHandle,
  GetAllEntitiesWithUuid, GetEntitiesAroundPosition, Create, Destroy,
  OnSystemUpdate, OnSystemPostUpdate, GetTrace, ClearTrace,
  GetRegisteredComponentTypes; EnableTracing stubbed), Ext.Stats 94.2%
  (49/52 — AddAttribute, AddEnumerationValue, ExecuteFunctors partial),
  Ext.Types 76.9% (10/13 — GetHashSetValueAt, AddCustomFunction,
  AddCustomProperty missing; the latter two are *functional* on Windows as
  Lua-side custom-property registration, Types.inl:328/347, not stubs as the
  deferral registry previously claimed). The prior 97.3% counted name
  presence; the interim 96.7% missed the function-substitution inflation.
  Methodology published in ROADMAP.md; analysis in docs/parity-100/.
- **`Ext.Types.Construct` leaves the parity denominator** — the Windows
  reference is itself `// TODO; return 0` (Types.inl:286); our nil matches
  its contract.
- **Scope-exclusion registry reconciled** — docs/deferrals.md is now the
  single authority: Ext.UI, DAP, Virtual Textures, and Input Injection are
  explicit exclusions; entity replication is ruled **non-excludable** (5 of
  11 vetted mods call `entity:Replicate()`) and stays a scored deferral.

### Fixed

- **Stale FixedString write diagnostic** (`component_property.c`) — interning
  works via `fixed_string_intern`; the real blocker is old-value
  DecRef/ownership transfer, and the refusal message now says so.
- **`GetHashSetValueAt` contract comment** — Windows is 1-based (Lua
  convention), not 0-based as the stub comment claimed.
- **`GetReplicationFlags` / `DisableTracing` contract notes** — upstream
  exposes `EnableTracing(bool)` only and puts `GetReplicationFlags` on the
  entity proxy; both placements documented in the deferral registry.

### Technical

- New `VersionOffsets` fields `fn_interrupt_proto_get` / `fn_passives_get`
  (0 = fail closed on 6995620), covered by `test_offset_audit.py` (73 green)
  and manifest-recipe guards.
- ARM64 slice of the 7209685 fat binary confirmed at file offset `0xf558000`
  via `otool -f` (documented; earlier RE notes carried a stale offset).
- Live gates on build 7209685: Tier 1 113/113; Tier 2 94/96 — the two
  failures are environment-dependent probes, not regressions:
  `Stats.DamageEvents.PairedFiring` needs a combat damage tick (BURNING
  applied out of combat produced no functor call) and
  `Parity.Level.SweepCylinderAll` sweeps fixed world-origin coordinates that
  hit no geometry in the current save's level. Offline gates: 55 C + 245
  pytest green.

## [v0.41.0] - 2026-07-30 — Wave 3: Parity Closure B — physics VMT repair, AiGrid pathfinding, ComponentOps unlock

**Category:** Parity | **Parity:** ~97.3% | **Issues:** Wave campaign plan (docs/plans/2026-07-28-001)

### Community vetting: Transmog Enhanced Revamped (2026-08-01, same version)

First community nomination from the issue #97 call for targets, vetted
same-day through the autonomous pipeline: **working**, 20/20 steps, baseline
saved (`docs/compat-reports/baseline/transmog_enhanced.json`).

- **Catalog + scenario**: `transmog_enhanced` added to `popular_mods.json`
  (Nexus 20407, v1.3.6, P2, no MCM) with an evidence-based API list read from
  the extracted PAK; 10-assertion manifest covers the exact-UUID load-order
  check, a live `Ext.Types.Serialize` roundtrip on a host-character component
  (the mod's actual cloning path via `Utils.TryToReserializeObject`),
  ModTable bootstrap, `CreateComponent`/`Replicate` method presence, a Tick
  subscribe roundtrip, and `RequestProcessed` listener registration.
- **Honest caveat documented**: the mod calls
  `entity:Replicate("GameObjectVisual")` — a macOS no-op (docs/deferrals.md).
  Single-player visuals sync through the mod's own Equip/Unequip cycle;
  multiplayer visual sync is the untested edge. This is the fifth
  vetted-corpus mod calling Replicate, reinforcing its top rank on the RE
  roadmap (docs/parity-100/).
- **Tests**: `EXPECTED_SCENARIOS` grew to 11; the baseline-coverage and
  schema guards now include the new scenario (243 pytest, all green).
- **Docs**: README vetted table and docs/supported-mods.md carry the new row;
  the nominator's cutscene claim is attributed, not asserted — the pipeline
  verifies API behavior, not scene rendering.

### Wave 5 review fix pass (2026-07-30, same version)

Four-lens review (silent-failure, correctness, tests, docs) over the Wave 5
span; correctness came back clean, all other confirmed findings fixed:

- **Empty modsettings.lsx no longer poisons the Ext.Mod cache** — a parse that
  found zero mods used to latch `g_uuids_loaded`, permanently pinning every
  `Ext.Mod` query to an empty cache with no retry and no warning. The flag now
  latches only on a non-empty parse; the zero-mod case logs a warning and
  re-parses on the next query (`src/lua/lua_mod.c`).
- **Mod UUID cache overflow now warns** — entries past MAX_MOD_UUIDS (128)
  were silently dropped from `GetLoadOrder`; the cap now logs which mod fell
  off the end.
- **Expansion Level 20 asserts by UUID** — the normalized needle 'expansion'
  could match any mod with "expansion" in its name; the manifest now checks
  the module UUID `a2c4b0fc` exactly, and the MCM manifest was migrated to the
  same normalized-name pattern as the other nine. Both baselines re-run live
  and re-saved (22/22, 27/27).
- **Four new pytest guards** (`tests/harness/test_scenarios.py`, 239 → 243,
  total 506): load-order assertions must use gsub normalization or exact UUID;
  vetted catalog entries must carry complete version/date/evidence stamps;
  the 10 committed baselines must parse, pass, and cover every scenario 1:1;
  MAX_OSIRIS_LISTENERS pinned at 512.
- **Docs truth pass** — supported-mods.md parity claim ~94% → ~97.3%, vet
  report example version v0.36.50 → v0.41.0, five stale API-coverage rows
  corrected to the deferral-aware counts (Types 13/15, Level 20/25, Audio
  17/17, Localization 4 functions, Math 59/59); `compat matrix` no-launch
  caveat documented in both harness docs; testing.md Stats section header
  14 → 16.
- Noted, not fixed: `lua_osiris_reset_listeners()` is dead code that would
  leak registry refs if ever wired up (comment added); the plain-bool
  `g_uuids_loaded` guard is technically unordered under C11 but init
  sequencing (dylib constructor before any Lua thread exists) makes the race
  unreachable.

### Wave 5: Top-10 Vetting Campaign (2026-07-30, same version)

All 10 top-priority mods vetted end-to-end with the autonomous compat pipeline
(`compat run <scenario> --launch --auto-install --save-baseline`): MCM 27/27,
Community Library 25/25, 5e Spells 23/23, Expansion Level 20 22/22, More
Reactive Companions 18/18, Party Limit Begone 20/20, Combat Extender 27/27
(MCM injected), Camp Event Notifications 22/22 (MCM injected), Auto Send Food
To Camp 22/22 (MCM injected), Always Show Approvals 20/20. Baselines committed
under `docs/compat-reports/baseline/`; catalog and `docs/supported-mods.md`
stamped working v0.41.0.

Fixes surfaced by the campaign:

- **Ext.Mod load-order snapshot pinned to launch time** — the game rewrites
  `modsettings.lsx` to the loaded save's mod list mid-session, so the lazy
  first parse in `lua_mod.c` could miss mods present at launch. New
  `lua_mod_prime_uuid_cache()` runs at injector init (matching Windows BG3SE's
  in-memory ModManager semantics); Community Library's load-order assertion
  went 24/25 → 25/25.
- **Osiris listener capacity 64 → 512, fail-loud on overflow** — Expansion
  Level 20 + companion-mod stacks exhausted the 64-slot table; the silent
  zero-return then surfaced as a nil-returning `RegisterListener`. The cap is
  now 512 and exhaustion raises a Lua error instead of returning nothing
  (`src/lua/lua_osiris.c`).
- **StaticData Feat assertions ForceCapture first** — `GetAll('Feat')` returns
  an empty table until managers are captured; the 5e Spells and Expansion
  manifests now call `Ext.StaticData.ForceCapture()` before asserting.
- **Load-order assertions made name-robust** — all 9 non-MCM manifests
  normalize case/whitespace/underscores before matching, and mods whose PAK
  metadata hides the public name assert by UUID instead: Party Limit Begone
  ships as a Gustav-module override (UUID `991c9c7a`), Camp Event
  Notifications ships as KvCampEvents (UUID `1b8d381f`), Expansion Level 20's
  module is named just "Expansion".

### Wave 4 review fix pass (2026-07-30, same version)

Four-lens review (silent-failure, correctness, tests, docs) over the Wave 4
span; all confirmed findings fixed at root cause:

- **Game can no longer be orphaned** — the entire post-launch section of
  `run_scenario` (identity, assertions, log scan, screenshot, crashlog) now
  runs inside try/finally; any exception, including Ctrl-C, still quits a
  game the run launched (`tools/bg3se_harness/compat.py`).
- **Enablement honesty** — a `set_mod_enabled` registry failure now fails the
  `mod_check` step instead of being recorded-but-ignored, and any successful
  enable marks `mod_state_changed` (the branch is only reached when the mod
  was absent from the load order), forcing the stale-game restart.
- **Download integrity** — a `.pak`-named download without the LSPK magic
  (e.g. an HTML challenge page served with HTTP 200) is now rejected as
  `invalid_archive` instead of installed; content sniffing no longer leaks a
  file handle.
- **Scenario-manifest correctness** — `Ext.Events.Subscribe` does not exist
  (events expose `Subscribe` per event object); three manifests now assert
  `Ext.Events.Tick.Subscribe`. `Ext.Stats.SetRawAttribute` is a StatsObject
  method, not a namespace function; combat_extender now asserts it on
  `Ext.Stats.Get('WPN_Longsword')`. Both were latent only because the old
  runner fabricated assertion success.
- **Fail-closed save handling** — snapshot/restore backup moves that fail
  now abort with the original data untouched; a failed restore copy rolls
  the user's save back from backup; backup names carry microseconds to
  survive sub-second successive restores.
- **No more false-clean scans** — `_scan_log_for_mod` returns a scan error
  distinct from "no errors found"; `run_scenario` fails the log-scan step
  and `vet_mod` downgrades the verdict from `working` when the log could
  not be read. Corrupt scenario JSON now warns to stderr instead of
  silently vanishing from the catalog.
- **Hygiene** — auto-install temp dirs are removed on success and marked
  `temp_dir_retained_for_debugging` on failure (compat + `mod install
  nexus:`); dead `requires_mcm` re-ordering code removed.
- **Tests: pytest 232 → 239 (total 502)** — regressions pinned for quit-on-exception,
  registry-enable failure, pak-magic rejection, scan-failure reporting,
  restore backup-move abort, snapshot-overwrite backup, clone metadata
  inheritance, and sentinel dict-shape (`output` vs `output_tail`).
- **Docs** — stale Tier-2 counts (93→95, 206→208) in docs/testing.md; wrong
  Nexus IDs in docs/supported-mods.md (7247→1879, 5978→6086, 5373→4675);
  `save snapshot/restore/clone`, `compat matrix` flags, `mod install
  nexus:<id>` and the `compat diff` index-keying caveat documented; the
  perpetually stale "37 Commands" header dropped.

### Wave 4 — Vetting Infrastructure (2026-07-30, same version)

- **Integrated compat pipeline** — `compat run <scenario> --launch --auto-install
  --save-baseline` is now a full autonomous vet: catalog-driven `requires_mcm`
  dependency injection (MCM prepended, deduped), missing mods downloaded from
  Nexus (Premium) and installed/enabled, save fixture restored, game launched
  via `_launch_until_socket` (`-continueGame`, retries, boot-health record),
  `!identity` handshake gating all Lua work, and a clean quit when the run
  launched the game itself. `compat diff <scenario>` compares the latest run
  step-by-step against `docs/compat-reports/baseline/` (regressions, fixes,
  added/removed steps).
- **Honest assertions** — the old runner logged every assertion as passed
  because `Console.send` returns Lua errors as text. Each assertion now runs
  inside `pcall` with a `BG3SE_COMPAT_PASS`/`BG3SE_COMPAT_FAIL:` sentinel;
  no sentinel in output is a failure, and assertions that cannot run are
  recorded as `not_run`, never as passes. This immediately exposed three
  manifests asserting `type(Ext.ModEvents.Subscribe) == 'function'` — it is a
  lazily-created mod-bucket table — which were corrected to the real per-mod
  event-object semantics.
- **`nexus.download_file()`** — Premium CDN download with ZIP extraction
  (path-traversal and flatten-collision rejection), content sniffing for
  extensionless files (LSPK magic → PAK, `is_zipfile` → ZIP; observed live:
  Expansion Level 20 ships as a bare-UUID ZIP), CDN URLs with literal spaces
  re-quoted (http.client rejects them), and catalog `file_id` pinning so mods
  whose newest "primary" file is a translation install the right file.
  `mod install nexus:<id>` now downloads and installs (old behavior behind
  `--links-only`).
- **Scenarios to 10** — added `expansion_lvl20`, `more_reactive_companions`,
  `camp_event_notifications`, `auto_send_food`, `always_show_approvals`; all
  10 manifests upgraded to Tier-2 execution assertions (load-order resolution
  by name, live entity/DB/StaticData/ModEvents/Tick/IMGUI-viewport calls
  against a loaded save) with the shared `vetting_base` fixture and
  `requires_save: true`. Schema + luac syntax validation in
  `tests/harness/test_scenarios.py`.
- **Save fixture integrity** — `restore()` previously copied fixtures into an
  invented `Harness__<name>` directory; BG3 requires
  `<Profile>-<id>__<DisplayName>/<DisplayName>.lsv` and `-continueGame` hangs
  at 0% on anything else (observed live). `snapshot` now records its source
  directory in a `fixture_meta.json` sidecar, `restore` writes back into that
  exact directory (backing up the current content outside the game's save
  tree), and fixtures without metadata refuse to restore.
- **Catalog corrections** — three wrong Nexus IDs fixed
  (camp_event_notifications 7247→1879 Kvalyr, auto_send_food 5978→6086
  Volitio, always_show_approvals 5373→4675 ancientbuho + explicit English
  `file_id`), expansion_lvl20 author corrected to DiZ91891.
- **Exit gate** — autonomous `compat run mcm --launch` passed 27/27 steps
  (launch → identity → 17 live assertions → launch-scoped log scan →
  screenshot → crashlog → quit); report saved as the MCM baseline and
  `compat diff mcm` verifies clean. Community vetting call posted as
  issue #97. Tests: pytest 210 → 232 (total 495).

### Added
- **Five AiGrid pathfinding/tile APIs** — `Ext.Level.GetPathById`,
  `ReleasePath`, `GetActivePathfindingRequests`, `FindPath`, and
  `GetEntitiesOnTile`, built on instruction-level RE of the AiGrid/AiPath/
  PathMap/tile layouts (`ghidra/offsets/AIGRID_PATHFINDING.md`). All state is
  copied into Lua-owned values; IDs resolve only through PathMap with `-1337`
  sentinel rejection; five new version-gated `fn_aigrid_*` offsets with exact
  nm manifest recipes.
- **Cylinder sweeps** — `Ext.Level.SweepCylinderClosest`/`SweepCylinderAll`
  at their proven macOS VMT slots (14/18).
- **`Entity:CreateComponent`** — dispatches through the verified ComponentOps
  registry (embedded DynamicArray at `EntityWorld+0x390`, Itanium vptr slot 5),
  fail-closed on every guard (`ghidra/offsets/COMPONENT_OPS_AND_PROTO_INIT.md`).
- **Ext.Math 100%** — `Smoothstep` and `IsNaN` added (59/59).
- **Ext.Audio 100%** — `LoadBank`, `UnloadBank`, `PrepareBank`,
  `UnprepareBank` via dlsym'd `AK::SoundEngine` exports (17/17).
- **Ext.Types Serialize/Unserialize** — real component-proxy serialization
  (13/15).
- **Ext.Localization UpdateTranslatedString/GetTranslatedString** — corrected
  `TryGet`/`AddTranslatedString` ABIs; update verified against the returned
  pool handle (live-verified round trip).
- **Entity enumeration** — `GetAllEntities`, `GetAllEntitiesWithComponent`,
  `GetAllComponents` are real archetype walks (live: 916 characters via
  `eoc::character::CharacterComponent`, 9,215 Health carriers).

### Fixed
- **PhysXScene VMT dispatch (critical)** — nine Windows-derived vtable
  indices were one slot early on macOS (Itanium dual-destructor shift):
  `RaycastClosest` dispatched `RemovePhysicsShape`, and every sphere/capsule/
  box sweep dispatched the preceding method. All nine corrected against the
  audited vtable (`ghidra/offsets/PHYSICS_VMT_AUDIT.md`); six sweep + two
  overlap call ABIs repaired to the proven AAPCS64 register shape
  (`Vector3f const&` as pointers, `PhysicsHitAll` output honored).
- **`stats_get_type` vtable-byte misread** — `ModifierListIndex` was read
  from offset 0x00 (the vtable pointer); real field proven at 0xE4 via
  `StatsObject::SetType`. `BURNING` now resolves as `StatusData`.
- **Refuted passive singleton** — `PassivePrototypeManager` `0x108aeccd8`
  has zero references in build 7209685; replaced with `eoc::Passives::m_ptr`
  at `0x1089bc228` (nm BSS symbol, 74 ADRP+LDR sites).
- **Parity scan transport** — multi-line Lua now sent as a proper block with
  results handed off via `Ext.IO.SaveFile` instead of racing the async
  console print.

### Deferred (fail-closed, documented in docs/deferrals.md)
- `Ext.Level.RaycastClosest/All/Any` — quarantined; trailing by-value
  `ls::Function`/`ls::Optional` parameters cannot be safely constructed from C.
- `Ext.Level.GetTileDebugInfo`, `BeginPathfinding` — OPEN layout evidence.
- `Entity:RemoveComponent` — 734 per-type template instantiations, no generic
  entry point.
- Passive/interrupt prototype sync — loader-inlined population, no top-level
  vptr (VMT-copy would corrupt).

### Review fix pass (four-lens subagent review of the Wave 3 span)
- **Fail-closed contracts** — `SweepCylinderAll`, `GetEntitiesOnTile`, and
  `GetActivePathfindingRequests` now return `nil` when the physics scene or
  AiGrid is unavailable instead of a truthy empty table, matching the other
  SweepAll bindings; "system offline" is now distinguishable from "no results".
- **`localization_ready` hardened** — the repository global is read through
  `safe_memory_read_pointer` like every other singleton accessor, so a bad
  data-shift on a future game update returns false instead of faulting.
- **Warn-once hygiene** — `CreateComponent` warns once per distinct guard
  (not once globally across its seven reasons); the Wwise bank gate warns once
  per operation; `GetNetId`, the pre-discovery component walkers, eight silent
  audio controls, and localization's subsystem-offline fallback all log a
  warn-once instead of failing silently.
- **parity.py** — timeout errors now distinguish "file never written" from
  "file written but never parsed cleanly" (reports the last JSON error).
- **Tests** — 2 new Tier 2 tests: `Wave3.Level.PathLookupLiveDispatch`
  (exercises `GetPathById` on a real path ID when active requests exist) and
  `Wave3.Audio.BankDispatchSmoke` (drives the dlsym'd `PrepareBank` dispatch);
  `ComponentEnumeration` threshold raised from >0 to >10 component names.

### Technical
- Test suite: 473 total (55 tier 0 C, 210 pytest, 113 tier 1, 95 tier 2).
- Live validation on build 7209685: tier 1 113/113, tier 2 93/93 at Wave 3
  closeout; physics smoke returns real geometry; paired damage-event firing
  re-verified via Fire Bolt functor.
- Offline vtable regression guard derives the ARM64 fat-slice offset from the
  Mach-O fat header (drifted 0xf534000 → 0xf558000 on this build) and joins
  every `PHYSICS_VMT_*` constant to its named symbol.
- Known coverage limits (documented, not silent): the successful native
  dispatch of `CreateComponent` and `FindPath`'s immediate branch have no
  repeatable regression test — both were live-verified once during Wave 3
  validation but need a game fixture that safely creates state.

## [v0.40.0] - 2026-07-29 — Wave 2: Parity Closure A — component writes, live damage events, Stats de-stubbing

**Category:** Parity | **Parity:** ~94.7% | **Issues:** Wave campaign plan (docs/plans/2026-07-28-001)

### Added
- **Component property writes** — `entity.Component.Field = value` is real for
  INT32, UINT8, BOOL, FLOAT, and INT32_ARRAY fields; writes to unknown-size
  layouts or unsupported field types are refused with `false` instead of
  silently corrupting memory (`src/entity/component_property.c`).
- **Live damage events** — `ExecuteFunctor`, `BeforeDealDamage`, and
  `DealDamage` fire from the game's functor execution path (all 10
  ExecuteStatsFunctors/ProcessDealDamageFunctors hooks). Verified live on
  build 7209685: 51/51 paired before/after events, 7,472-execution soak.
- **TreasureTable/TreasureCategory reads** — real data from the game's
  treasure managers (fail-closed memory reads), no longer empty tables.
- **GetStatsLoadedMods** — returns the actual mod load order.
- **Spell/status prototype sync** — `Ext.Stats.Sync` populates real
  SpellPrototype/StatusPrototype objects (status path copies the VMT from a
  template prototype before the game's `Init` runs).
- **`Ext.Debug.GetHookStatus().functor_hooks_installed`** — surfaces the
  functor hook install count (0-10); partial installs log an ERROR.

### Fixed
- **Hidden `result_out` ABI** — all 9 `esv::functor::ExecuteStatsFunctors`
  overloads return `esv::functor::Result` via a hidden leading x0 out-param;
  wrappers now accept and forward it (root cause of the Wave 2 crash class).
- **Test honesty** — `stats_sync` returns its computed result instead of
  unconditional `true`; `sync_interrupt_prototype` and passive sync honestly
  return `false` (Init layouts unverified for 7209685); FixedStringRefused
  degrades gracefully when the save lacks its fixture.
- Menu-stall scare adjudicated as a non-regression: `-continueGame` auto-load
  rides the documented Noesis focus race (FocuslessInput's injected Space),
  not any dylib change (three independent codex debugger reports,
  `docs/bugs/wave2-menu-stall-*.md`).

### Technical
- Review-pass hardening from four parallel subagent audits
  (`docs/bugs/wave2-review-findings-2026-07-29.md`).
- Test suite now 429 tests: 55 C (Tier 0) + 191 pytest (Tier H) +
  109 Tier 1 + 74 Tier 2.

## [v0.39.0] - 2026-07-29 — Community PR integration: offset-table architecture + Osiris DB access + mod runtime

**Category:** Community contributions | **Parity:** ~94.7% | **Issues:** PR #91, PR #93, PR #95

Integration of the two community pull requests, reconciled with the current
codebase rather than merged verbatim (both predated the v0.38.x mod-detection
and game-path work). Credit: **@mikowals** (PR #91 — per-version offset table,
build 7209685 support, `tools/port_offsets.py`) and **@marcus-sa** (PR #93 —
Osiris database RE + Facts reader, per-mod `_ENV` sandbox, module cache,
GameStateChanged EnumValues, Ext.IO VFS semantics).

### Added
- **Per-version offset table** (`src/core/offset_table.c/h`) — every
  game-version-dependent address lives in one audited table; unknown versions
  fail closed. `tools/port_offsets.py` semi-automates migration to new builds
  (PR #91, mikowals).
- **Osi.DB_* real database reads** — name-index walk of `COsiFunctionMan`
  discovers Osiris databases (invisible to the id-probe); `Osi.DB_X:Get(...)`
  walks the CReteDBase Facts list directly with typed filters, Windows-style
  (PR #93, marcus-sa; RE documented in `ghidra/offsets/OSIRIS_DATABASES.md`).
- **Signature-typed Osi dispatch** — parameter types/directions read from the
  game's OsirisInterface function defs (offset-table gated); pure test queries
  return integer 0/1, out-param queries return values or nil (Windows parity).
- **Per-mod `_ENV` sandbox** — mod chunks execute inside `Mods.<ModTable>`
  with `__index = _G` fallback and mod-local `_G`/`ModuleUUID`; registry-backed
  module cache; bare `require()` resolves mod-relative then falls through to
  stock Lua require (PR #93, marcus-sa).
- **GameStateChanged EnumValues** — `ClientGameState`/`ServerGameState`
  registered in `Ext.Enums`; event states and `Ext.Utils.GetGameState()` return
  EnumValue userdata comparable with `==` (MCM's init gate).
- **Deferred IMGUI event queue** — widget callbacks (OnClick/OnChange/OnClose)
  queue from the Metal render thread and drain on the main thread under the
  Lua gate (render-thread dispatch crashed `ls::Scene::Cull`); object-pool
  mutex; HID-level CGEvent tap so mod keybindings see normal keys (PR #93,
  marcus-sa).
- **Local net transport by default** — Ext.Net/NetChannel traffic routes
  through the in-process message bus and never touches the game's
  `net::MessageFactory` (whose unbounded pool indexing crashed on the
  extender's message id); RakNet is opt-in via `BG3SE_NET_RAKNET=1`;
  `Ext.Net.CreateChannel` exposed for MCM (PR #93, marcus-sa).

### Fixed
- Hardening pass from a four-agent review (two Codex, two Claude) over the
  integration: CTuple small-object storage, stale-registry re-walk on save
  load, param-def validation, engine-string safe reads, Ext.IO path
  containment, PAK entry bounds validation, per-mod loader state clearing.

---

## [v0.38.1] - 2026-07-29 — Community issue triage: mod detection + game-path discovery

**Category:** Compatibility fixes | **Parity:** ~94.7% | **Issues:** #87, #81, #90, #86, #84, #82, #88

Every open community issue triaged against v0.38.0 and answered on GitHub; the four
with live defects are fixed here. Credit to Rminnl (#87) for the PAK-filename
fallback that seeded the mod-detection fix.

### Fixed
- **SE mod detection: display name vs PAK directory (#87, #81)** — Detection built
  every lookup path from the modsettings.lsx display name, so mods whose internal
  PAK directory differs (MCM: "Mod Configuration Menu" vs `Mods/BG3MCM/`) were
  invisible. `mod_pak_find_se_dir()` now tries the display name, then the PAK
  filename stem; a third detection phase enumerates every PAK's
  `Mods/*/ScriptExtender/Config.json` and picks up mods matching neither (Trials
  of Tav), plus multi-mod PAKs. The resolved directory (`mod_get_se_dir`) drives
  bootstrap loading, and `get_mod_table_name()` reads Config.json out of the PAK
  so PAK-only mods get their real `Mods.<ModTable>` namespace.
- **Game-path discovery (#90, #86)** — The game path was hardcoded to the default
  Steam library in the launch script, deploy hook, harness config, and the dylib's
  version detection. All four now resolve identically: `BG3SE_GAME_PATH` env
  override → default library → every library in `steamapps/libraryfolders.vdf`
  (external drives). Shared shell resolver: `scripts/find_bg3.sh`. A missing game
  is now a deploy warning, not a build failure.
- **launch_bg3.sh injection marker (#84)** — The script checked
  `/tmp/bg3se_loaded.txt`, which the dylib never wrote, so successful injections
  warned as failures. It now verifies the real session log
  (`~/Library/Application Support/BG3SE/logs/latest.log`) against the launch
  timestamp. The dead `SENTINEL_PATH` constant is gone from the harness config.

### Added
- `src/mod/mod_paths.c/h` — dependency-free SE directory-name resolution helpers
- 14 Tier-0 tests (`tests/tier0/test_mod_paths.c`) covering stem derivation and
  PAK-entry matching; 10 pytest cases (`tests/harness/test_game_path.py`) covering
  vdf parsing and override precedence — offline suite now 209 (55 C + 154 pytest),
  385 total
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` — "'tuple' file not found" SDK entry (#88) and the
  arm64e-misdiagnosis correction with real injection failure causes (#82)

---

## [v0.38.0] - 2026-07-28 — Thread-safe Lua core + launch-lifecycle hardening

**Category:** Stability + harness infrastructure | **Parity:** ~94.7%

Three crash classes found and fixed in one night of live soaking, then the whole
native-to-Lua boundary was serialized behind a single recursive gate. The harness
gained a process-identity layer: it now proves *which* BG3 process it is talking to
(and whether that process has a loaded session) before trusting a single test result —
closing the failure mode where a replacement process rebound the console socket and
24 tier-2 "failures" were really a menu process with no save loaded.

### Fixed
- **Lua cross-thread race (crash)** — Four threads entered the shared `lua_State`
  unsynchronized (ServerWorker dispatch, GCD console timer, Metal render callbacks,
  input hotkeys). New `src/lua/lua_gate.c/h` recursive mutex serializes every
  native-to-Lua entry: `fake_Event`/`fake_InitGame`/`fake_Load`, Osiris dispatch,
  console poll (trylock — skip on contention), ImGui events + native ref cleanup,
  hotkeys, network callbacks, functor events, log-event dispatch, and the Shutdown
  event. All entry points resolve their `lua_State` *under* the gate; `shutdown_lua`
  clears every published state pointer while holding it, so blocked waiters can
  never enter a freed VM.
- **Logging lock inversion** — `log_write_v` now snapshots callbacks under the
  logging mutex and invokes them after release, establishing one global lock order
  (Lua gate → logging mutex) and eliminating an ABBA deadlock plus a self-deadlock
  when a Lua Log handler logs.
- **MAP_JIT trampoline fault (crash)** — `arm64_hook_at_offset` wrote trampolines
  without `pthread_jit_write_protect_np(0)`; masked by near-branch allocation until
  an unlucky ASLR slide forced the far-trampoline fallback. Write gate now brackets
  the build, re-protected before `sys_icache_invalidate`.
- **Overlay console SIGBUS (crash)** — TextKit 2 relayout storm under tier-2 output
  flood. Console view forces TextKit 1, coalesces lines into one batched append per
  main-queue drain, caps storage at 500KB; `clearOutput` is linearized into the same
  ordered pending stream as appends (clear sentinel), so pre-clear text cannot replay
  and post-clear text cannot be erased by a shared scheduled flush.
- **Version contract coherence** — the 2026-07-28 address migration left
  `BG3_KNOWN_VERSION` and the three layout sentinels at their pre-migration values,
  so the exact-version gate rejected the very build the addresses were derived for.
  All three now move in lockstep with the per-subsystem offsets, and the eleven
  functor-hook code patches (stripped locals, un-auditable by `nm`) gate on their own
  `FUNCTOR_ADDRS_VERIFIED_BUILD` constant — a global version bump can never silently
  enable unverified code patches. `ResourceManager::m_ptr` and
  `ResourceContainer::GetResource` were also stale from the same migration and are
  now re-derived and covered by the offset audit.
- **`BG3SE_DISABLE` destructor side effects** — a disabled image ran the full
  cleanup path at unload (events, hook removal, ImGui teardown) despite never
  initializing. The destructor is now inert unless this image won the duplicate
  election *and* began initialization, restoring the kill switch's zero-side-effects
  contract.
- **ImGui callback ref resolved under the gate** — `lua_imgui_fire_event` captured
  the registry ref before acquiring the Lua gate; gated Lua code could unref and
  reuse the slot while the render thread blocked, invoking the wrong function. Both
  the state and the ref now resolve under the gate.
- **Windowed-mode ground truth** — display mode lives in `graphicSettings.lsx` as
  `FakeFullscreenEnabled` (absent = borderless, `0` = windowed), written only by the
  in-game Options → Video menu. The harness no longer injects display-mode keys and
  restores are per-key (ScreenWidth/Height only), so automation can never revert the
  user's windowed choice or seize the screen with a fullscreen relaunch.

### Added
- **`!identity` console handshake** — JSON with pid, version, game state,
  session-init state, stats readiness, and dylib image path (JSON-escaped, with a
  truncation-safe fallback). The harness `wait_for_socket()` now *enforces* it:
  the identity PID must match the tracked process, with `LOCAL_PEERPID` as a
  secondary check whose errors count as unverified rather than a pass. Any BG3SE
  instance rebinding `/tmp/bg3se.sock` is now rejected instead of silently trusted.
- **Duplicate-dylib guard** — the insert_dylib patch and `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`
  could both load a copy of the dylib into one process (two Lua states, two
  exception handlers, observed live). The constructor now elects exactly one image
  per process via the environment; the second logs itself and fully disables.
- **Launch-attempt lifecycle (`ProcessTracker`/`LaunchSession`)** — the harness
  tracks a launch as an identity (exact executable + process start time) with PID
  lineage, adopting the Steam-relaunched successor exactly once within a bounded
  grace window. Adoption fails closed on a missing executable, requires the exact
  expected path, and rejects candidates outside the relaunch window; stale PID files
  are re-validated against live process identity before any SIGTERM, so PID reuse
  can never terminate an unrelated process. Ambiguous candidates are a hard
  failure, never `pgrep | head -1`.
- **Preflight gates** — launches now refuse early with actionable errors: Steam IPC
  not ready (Steam-less sessions self-exit at ~90-150s via DRM grace), critical
  memory pressure (<10% free blocks; jetsam storms kill ReportCrash and Steam),
  unowned BG3 instance already running, or windowed mode unverified for `--headless`.
  `doctor` gained severity levels and four new checks.
- **Session driver rework** (`scripts/session_driver.sh`) — consumes the harness
  launch record, verifies PID + start time each poll, tolerates the Steam bounce in
  a settling phase, validates arguments, and adds `PREFLIGHT_FAILED` (4) and
  `AMBIGUOUS_ATTACH` (5) verdicts.
- **64 new offline tests** — launch-lifecycle state machine, Steam bounce adoption,
  identity handshake parsing, peer verification (fail-closed), memory thresholds,
  monitor restore-exactly-once, windowed-mode checks, headless launch gate, and a
  functor-gate guard in the offset audit. Offline gate now 41 C + 144 pytest.

### Technical
- **Breaking:** `doctor` now exits 1 only on failed *critical* checks (severity
  levels critical/warning/info); scripts relying on exit 0 = "every check passed"
  must inspect the JSON instead.
- Console poll timer logs a starvation warning after 50 consecutive gate misses (~5s).
- Functor hook installation now honors `BG3SE_NO_HOOKS` and gates on
  `FUNCTOR_ADDRS_VERIFIED_BUILD` (the build its stripped-local addresses were
  derived from) instead of the global version match.
- `log_unregister_callback` lifetime contract documented: unregistration is
  asynchronous relative to in-flight snapshotted invocations; callers must keep
  callback state valid until drained (the Lua log callback does this via the gate).
- `--allow-memory-pressure` is now an actual CLI flag on `launch` and `test`
  (previously only advertised by the refusal message).
- Steam-relaunch timeout now lands the tracker in the `steam_relaunch_timeout`
  terminal phase; the detached monitor treats an unknowable exit status as a
  potential bounce (bounded + identity-checked) instead of a generic death.
- `GameStateChanged → LoadSession` fires only after a successful `COsiris::Load`,
  so a failed load can no longer strand the state tracker.
- Graphics restore in the detached monitor is exactly-once and never fires on the
  Steam bootstrap exit (the race that previously flashed the user to fullscreen).

**Category:** Headless automation + console infrastructure | **Parity:** ~94%

Headless CLI mode now works end-to-end: `launch --headless` achieves `socket_connected`
in ~3s, window hidden via System Events, game runs in background at 1280x720 windowed.
Console socket now responds at main menu (not just during gameplay) via GCD dispatch timer.
Focus hack reintegrated to bypass Noesis input gate for background operation.
The harness now also diagnoses save-load crashes by scanning installed PAKs, reconciling
the registry, inferring save-required mods from `.lsv` archives, and classifying macOS
`.ips` crash reports against BG3SE logs.

### Added
- **Console poll timer** — GCD dispatch timer (100ms) in `init_lua()` polls
  `console_poll(L)` independently of Osiris events. Previously the socket only
  responded inside `fake_Event()` (Osiris hook), which never fires at the main menu.
  Uses atomic flag to prevent concurrent Lua access from game thread.
- **Focus hack module** (`src/game/focus_hack.c`) — Forces `BaseApp+0x142` focus
  flag to 1, bypassing Noesis GUI input gate that clears the device queue when app
  lacks focus. Deferred polling (500ms, max 30 attempts) waits for `BaseApp::s_AppInstance`
  at VA `0x108ac0278`.
- **Headless mode verified** — `launch --headless` confirmed working: build → patch →
  launch (windowed 1280x720) → socket responds (3.3s) → window hidden → graphics restored.
- **Installed PAK inventory and registry reconciliation** — `mod scan --installed`
  parses every installed `.pak`; `mod reconcile --installed [--write]` reports or
  registers PAKs missing from the harness registry.
- **Save-load mod preflight** — `launch --continue`, `launch --save`, and `test`
  run `mod preflight` before real launches unless `--no-mod-preflight` is passed.
  `--accept-mod-verification` documents runs where BG3's Mod Verification dialog is
  expected and may need menu automation.
- **Save-required mod inference** — `save mods [--continue|NAME]` opens `.lsv`
  save archives, reads `SaveInfo.json`, and scans decompressed entries for UUID,
  folder, and name markers. The current Ebonlake save reports six high-confidence
  required content mods and one low-confidence name-only candidate.
- **Modsettings verification** — `mod verify --modsettings [--continue|--save NAME]`
  checks active mods against registry, installed PAKs, and save-required markers.
  `--expected-order` accepts an exact UUID order JSON file for deterministic order checks.
- **macOS crash attribution** — `crashlog` now parses `.ips` reports, matches the
  crashing PID to BG3SE logs, extracts the enabled mod list, and classifies the
  observed save crash as `post_level_loaded_hotbar_update`.
- **PAK/LSV metadata support** — PAK inspection now reads `Folder` and dependency
  `ModuleShortDesc` metadata from `meta.lsx`, and can decompress LSV compression type
  `3` through the local `zstd` binary when present.

### Known Issues
- **`-continueGame` hotbar crash still needs live retest** — The crash is now
  classified after `LevelLoaded/GainedControl` rather than treated as opaque. Current
  evidence shows the high-confidence save-required mods are active, four dependency/SE
  mods are active extras, and `libbg3se` is not on the faulting stack. Next steps are a
  live headless retest with the reconciled registry and a deterministic `modsettings.lsx`
  writer if exact load-order reconstruction is still needed.

## [v0.36.50+e2e] - 2026-05-04 — 4-Tier test suite + observability APIs + 3 bug fixes

**Category:** Testing infrastructure + debug APIs + bug fixes | **Parity:** ~94%

Full 4-tier test architecture: 213 total tests. 66 offline (C + pytest), 147 in-game
Lua (93 Tier 1 + 54 Tier 2) including 22 new behavioral parity tests. Five debug
observability APIs expose C-layer internals to Lua. Three confirmed bugs fixed with
regression tests. CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions.

### Added
- **Tier 0: Native C unit tests** (41 tests) — `tests/tier0/` with CMake target
  `bg3se_test_tier0`. Covers safe_memory (17), pattern_scan (10), osiris_handles (8),
  entity_events (6). No game dependency, runs in CI.
- **Tier H: Python harness tests** (25 tests) — `tests/harness/` with pytest.
  Covers test_runner parsing, launch lifecycle, CLI commands, mod name resolution,
  savegame backup, and log timestamp scoping.
- **Tier 1 parity tests** (8 tests) — Behavioral tests: SafeMemoryEdges,
  FunctorSubscribePair, PriorityOncePrevent, Stats.GetBehavior, Stats.GetAllReturnsData,
  Timer.WaitForCancel, Audio.PlayExternalSoundEdge, Types.SerializeRoundtrip.
- **Tier 2 parity tests** (14 tests) — In-game behavioral tests: Entity roundtrips
  (Host, Handle, InvalidInputs, ComponentEnumeration, TypeIdDiscovery, RegistryCounts,
  HealthLayoutSnapshot), Stats (CanonicalCounts, LongswordShape), Osi (DBPlayers,
  ListenerBeforeAfter), Level.RaycastShape, IMGUI.WidgetSurface, Net.PostMessage.
- **5 debug observability APIs** — `Ext.Debug.GetHookStatus()`,
  `Ext.Debug.GetVersionStatus()`, `Ext.Debug.GetCacheStats()`,
  `Ext.Debug.GetEventStatus()`, `Ext.Debug.GetManagerStatus()`.
- **GitHub Actions CI** — `.github/workflows/test-offline.yml` runs both offline
  tiers on `push` and `pull_request`.
- **`_resolve_uuid()` in mod_cli** — name→UUID resolution via registry substring
  match for `mod enable`/`mod disable` commands.

### Fixed
- **`mod enable <name>` passed name to UUID-expecting function** — now resolves
  via registry substring match (same pattern as `uninstall()`).
- **`savegames.restore()` destroyed existing saves** — now moves to timestamped
  backup directory before overwriting.
- **`compat._scan_log_for_mod()` matched stale log entries** — now accepts
  `since_timestamp` parameter; `vet` caller passes report start time.

---

## [v0.36.50+compat] - 2026-04-29 — BG3MacModManager compatibility + SE mod vetting

**Category:** Harness tooling + C parser fix | **Parity:** ~94%

Two themes: (A) interoperability fixes so the harness mod management pipeline
produces modsettings.lsx files that BG3MacModManager, BG3, and the SE all agree
on, and (B) a new `compat vet` command that probes a running game to generate
per-mod compatibility reports.

### Added
- **`compat vet` command** — vets a mod from the catalog, by Nexus ID, or by
  local PAK path. Resolves source, probes the SE socket, scans `latest.log`
  for mod-specific errors, and writes a JSON report to `docs/compat-reports/`.
- **SE mod auto-detection** — `PakReader.contains_script_extender()` scans PAK
  index for `ScriptExtender/Config.json` and tags the mod as SE-required.
- **ModCrashSanityCheck doctor check** — warns when Patch 8+ directory exists
  (causes BG3 to deactivate externally-managed mods).
- **File lock detection** — `doctor` checks for macOS immutable flag
  (`chflags uchg`) on `modsettings.lsx`. Write path returns clear error.
- **Expanded mod catalog** — `popular_mods.json` grows from 8 to 17 mods
  across three tiers (P0-P3).
- **UUID validation** — `compat vet` validates UUID format before Lua socket
  interpolation (security hardening).

### Changed
- **modsettings.lsx format** — `PublishHandle` attribute added, UUID type
  changed from `FixedString` to `guid` (matches BG3MacModManager).
- **C parser updated** — `lua_mod.c` now accepts both `type="FixedString"` and
  `type="guid"` for UUID attributes in modsettings.lsx.
- **Deterministic UUID** — SHA-256-based version-5 UUIDs matching
  BG3MacModManager's algorithm (was MD5).
- **docs/supported-mods.md** — rewritten with tiered tables, vet workflow,
  failure categories, ~94% API coverage table.

### Fixed
- **`mod list` crash** — `AttributeError` when result dict has no `success` key.
- **Crash detection** — `run_scenario` now checks `signal` key (was checking
  nonexistent `crash_detected`).
- **`bootstrap_executed` false positive** — guarded on valid UUID.
- **Log scanner over-match** — empty mod name no longer returns all errors.
- **ImprovedUI Nexus ID** — corrected from 366 to 4688.

## [v0.36.50+harness] - 2026-04-23 — bg3se-harness: a CLI for Baldur's Gate 3

**Category:** Harness tooling (Python CLI, no dylib changes) | **Parity:** ~94%

This release marks the public debut of `bg3se-harness` as a fully-featured CLI
for Baldur's Gate 3—one of the first command-line interfaces purpose-built for
a AAA RPG.  We built a similar CLI for [cliamp](https://github.com/tdimino/cliamp)
and saw the same pattern take hold there: once a game or application exposes its
internals through a composable, JSON-emitting command line, agent-driven
workflows emerge naturally.  We believe CLIs for games will become as
second-nature as command palettes are in editors today, and we're excited to see
what the modding community builds on top of this.

The harness ships 36 commands spanning the full Script Extender lifecycle—build,
patch, launch, test, entity inspection, RPG stats diffing, Lua hot-reload,
screenshots, crash diagnostics, mod management, Nexus Mods API queries,
bg3.wiki cross-reference, and a Ghidra RE bridge—all from the terminal, all
emitting structured JSON.

### Added
- **Skip intro videos** — `launch` and `test` automatically suppress BG3 intro videos via a three-layer defense: `defaults write com.larian.bg3 SkipVideo -bool true` (UserDefaults), `SkipVideo=1`/`SkipSplashScreen=1` injected into `graphicSettings.lsx` (ConfigEntry), and the existing CGEvent Space fallback.  Enabled by default; opt out with `--no-skip-videos`.
- **`bg3se-harness mod changelog <id>`** — fetches the per-version changelog
  JSON for a Nexus mod.  Entries are stripped of HTML so downstream tools
  get plain text; the ``entries_html`` field preserves the original markup.
  Versions are sorted newest-first via a tolerant sort key that handles
  SemVer, ISO dates, and month-name date strings (``2024April-30``).
- **`bg3se-harness mod versions <id>`** — lists every file attached to a
  mod (file_id, name, version, category, size, timestamps) so harness users
  can locate historical builds.
- **`bg3se-harness mod updated [--period 1d|1w|1m]`** — lists Nexus mods
  updated in the given window.  Validates the period client-side; invalid
  values fail with a ``validation_error`` envelope before any HTTP call.
- **`bg3se-harness wiki spell <name>`** — resolves a spell by display name
  via MediaWiki OpenSearch and returns the parsed ``{{Feature page | ...}}``
  template fields (level, school, damage, damage type, uid, classes, ...).
- **`bg3se-harness wiki item <name>`** — same, for weapons/armour via
  ``{{WeaponPage}}`` / ``{{ArmourPage}}`` / ``{{EquipmentPage}}`` / related
  templates.
- **`bg3se-harness wiki verify <page> [--expect-uid UID]`** — offline
  cross-reference: fetches a wiki page and optionally checks its ``uid``
  field against a known stat name.  Runtime-diff against ``Ext.Stats.Get``
  remains a follow-up (see the scope note on ``wiki.verify_page``).
- **`bg3se-harness wiki clear-cache`** — wipes the 24h file cache under
  ``~/.config/bg3se-harness/wiki_cache/``.
- **`mod_manager.nexus`** — added ``get_mod_files``, ``get_changelogs``,
  ``get_updated`` wrappers and the ``_version_sort_key`` helper.
- **``bg3se_harness.wiki``** — new top-level module.  Stdlib-only (no
  ``requests``/``httpx``), SHA-1-keyed file cache, alias-pointer files for
  case-insensitive lookups, bracket-aware MediaWiki template tokeniser with
  HTML-comment stripping, fixed-point nested-template expansion.
- **Tests**: ``tests_wiki.py`` (23 offline tests) and 14 new cases in
  ``tests_nexus.py`` (23 total) covering cache semantics, 403
  classification, version sort, comment-in-pipe tokenisation, nested
  template expansion, and path-containment sandbox.

### Changed
- **``_classify_403``** — path-aware classifier for Nexus 403 responses.
  Rule cascade: ``/users/...`` paths → ``auth_error``; strong body markers
  (``adult``, ``content filter``, ``permission to view``, ...) →
  ``content_restricted``; ``/mods/\d+`` per-mod detail paths →
  ``content_restricted`` by default; fallback → ``auth_error``.  Collection
  endpoints (``/mods/search.json``, ``/mods/updated.json``) correctly fall
  through to the auth fallback.
- **``_version_sort_key``** — new tolerant sort key.  Tokenises mixed
  alphanumeric chunks and resolves month names via ``_MONTH_NAMES`` so
  ``2024May-1`` sorts after ``2024April-30`` (mod 2172's real pattern).
  SemVer prerelease / build metadata limitations documented in the
  docstring.
- **``_try_request``** — reads the ``HTTPError`` body once, decodes with
  ``errors="replace"``, and tries JSON parsing on a single copy.  The
  previous over-broad ``except Exception`` around ``exc.read()`` narrowed
  to ``(OSError, AttributeError, ValueError)`` so real bugs surface.
- **``search_mods``** — skips client-side substring filtering when results
  come from ``/mods/search.json`` (server-ranked), keeps the filter when
  falling back to ``/mods/updated.json``.
- **``mod_cli``** — ``list``, ``search``, ``backup`` branches now honour
  ``{"success": False}`` envelopes in their exit codes, matching the
  convention added by ``changelog``/``versions``/``updated``.
- **``_HTMLStripper``** — symmetric ``<br>`` handling, removed dead
  ``except Exception`` fallback around ``HTMLParser.feed``.

### Technical
- **Wiki cache hardening**.  Keys are SHA-1 truncated to 32 hex chars
  (collision-resistant, no path-traversal surface, no truncation hazard).
  Aliases are pointer files ``{"alias_for": "CanonicalTitle"}`` rather than
  duplicated payloads — eliminates the two-writer staleness race the
  previous double-payload scheme carried.  Every cache read/write resolves
  inside the cache directory (``path.resolve().relative_to(root)``); a key
  that escapes the sandbox is rejected.  ``~/.config/bg3se-harness/`` and
  ``~/.config/bg3se-harness/wiki_cache/`` are created with ``0o700``
  permissions.  Stderr cache warnings are rate-limited to once per
  process.  Entries carry a ``cached_kind`` tag so ``query_spell`` /
  ``query_item`` / ``verify_page`` never read each other's payloads.
- **Template tokeniser blind spots** documented in
  ``_parse_template_fields``: ``<nowiki>|</nowiki>``, ``{{!}}`` magic word,
  raw table markup, HTML entities.  None appear in real BG3.wiki spell /
  item pages as of 2026-04, so we trade completeness for simplicity and
  flag the limitations in the docstring.
- **``wiki.py`` moved** from ``tools/bg3se_harness/mod_manager/wiki.py`` to
  ``tools/bg3se_harness/wiki.py`` to match the plan and the peer modules
  (``parity.py``, ``compat.py``, ``savegames.py``).

### Plan tracking
- Chunks 1 and 2 of ``~/.claude/plans/2026-04-06-bg3se-harness-opencli-integration.md``
  shipped; Chunks 3–9 (OpenCLI manifest, upstream-parity tracker, trending
  mods, doctor opencli, graceful degradation) remain.  Deviations from the
  original plan (Cargo → opensearch pivot, verify-as-field-printer) are
  recorded in the plan file's "Deviation log" section.

## [v0.36.50] - 2026-04-02

**Parity:** ~94% | **Category:** Crash Fixes, Build System, Safety | **Issues:** #78, #77, #73

### Fixed
- **Hotbar crash on new game start** (Issue #78): Thread-unsafe signal handlers in `entity_events.c` caused EXC_BAD_ACCESS on ServerWorker thread. Fixed with atomic `g_lua_state` (acquire/release ordering), deferred connection buffer freeing (prevents use-after-free during Signal iteration), and a transition guard that suspends signal dispatch during game state transitions.
- **Build error on CommandLineTools-only systems** (Issue #77): Added CMake sysroot auto-detection via `xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path` with fallback to CommandLineTools SDK path. Fixes `'tuple' file not found` when building `.mm` files without full Xcode.
- **SIGSEGV after game hotfix** (Issue #73): Added game version detection from `Info.plist`. When the detected version doesn't match the known-good version (`4.1.1.6995620`), address-dependent features (prototype managers) are disabled gracefully instead of crashing from stale singleton pointers.
- **Python 3.9 compatibility**: Added `from __future__ import annotations` to `flags.py` — fixes `TypeError` from PEP 604 union syntax (`str | bool`) on macOS system Python 3.9.
- **Code signing robustness**: `_sign_binary()` now temporarily moves non-Mach-O files (`.log`, `.bg3se-*`) out of `Contents/MacOS/` before `codesign` to prevent subcomponent warnings.

### Added
- **`version_detect.c/h`**: New game binary version detection subsystem. Reads `CFBundleShortVersionString` from BG3's `Info.plist`, compares against known-good version, logs warnings on mismatch.
- **`entity_events_set_transition()`**: Public API for suspending/resuming entity event signal handlers during game state transitions.

### Technical
- `g_lua_state` in `entity_events.c` is now `_Atomic(lua_State*)` with `memory_order_acquire`/`memory_order_release` — eliminates ARM64 weak-memory-ordering race
- Deferred free list (max 256 entries) for old Signal connection buffers — freed on next main-thread tick instead of immediately
- Prototype managers skip address-dependent init when version mismatch detected

---

## [v0.36.49+qedeshot] - 2026-03-28

**Parity:** ~94% | **Category:** Qedeshot Knesset Swarm — Feature Parity Push | **Issues:** #78

### Added
- **6 Sweep functions** (Ext.Level): SweepSphereClosest, SweepCapsuleClosest, SweepBoxClosest, SweepSphereAll, SweepCapsuleAll, SweepBoxAll — VMT dispatch via PhysicsScene, Ghidra-verified slot indices
- **RaycastAll** (Ext.Level): Multi-hit raycast returning all intersections
- **PlayExternalSound** (Ext.Audio): Re-enabled with correct macOS STDString ABI construction
- **6 Ext.Types functions**: GetAllTypes, GetTypeInfo, GetObjectType, TypeOf, IsA, Validate, GetComponentLayout, GetAllLayouts, GenerateIdeHelpers (VS Code IntelliSense)
- **Ext.Localization.CreateHandle**: Localization handle creation (completes Ext.Localization namespace)
- **Ext.Math.Fract**: Fractional part function (completes Ext.Math namespace)
- **Generic Osi.DB_\* accessor**: `Osi.DB_Players:Get()`, `Osi.DB_IsTag:Get()`, etc. — read-only database query for any Osiris DB
- **Entity: CreateComponent, RemoveComponent**: Attach/detach components via ComponentOps struct
- **Entity: GetEntityType, GetSalt, GetIndex, GetNetId**: Handle introspection and network ID access
- **ExecuteFunctor Dobby hook**: Intercepts functor execution for BeforeDealDamage/DealDamage event objects
- **8+ polling events**: One-frame engine events with cached TypeIndex, listener-count guards, table reuse
- **Version detection sentinel probes** (Issue #78): Sentinel address validation for game version mismatch tolerance — address-dependent features disable gracefully on unknown game versions

### Fixed
- **osiris_call_by_id unsafe pfn_InternalCall fallback removed**: Eliminated dangerous fallback path that could dispatch calls with wrong function pointer signatures

### Technical
- 23 commits across 4 feature branches (al-uzza, tip'eret, mami, kaptaru), merged sequentially
- Parity pushed from ~93% to ~94% in a single Qedeshot swarm session
- Optimized polling with cached TypeIndex lookups and listener-count guards to minimize per-frame overhead

## [v0.36.50] - 2026-02-11

**Parity:** ~94% | **Category:** Osiris Crash Fix, Test Fixes, Init Timing | **Issues:** #66, #68

### Fixed
- **Osiris TooManyArgs crash** (Issue #66): Passing more arguments than a function's arity to `Osi.*` queries caused EXC_BAD_ACCESS (NULL+0xC) as the game walked past the arg chain. Now clamps `numArgs` to `arity` before dispatch, extra args silently discarded.
- **3 MCM test failures**: `ModEvents.Subscribe/Throw/Unsubscribe` are table namespaces (with `__index`), not plain functions. Tests now correctly assert `type == 'table'`.
- **Stats.SetRawAttribute test**: Was testing nonexistent `Ext.Stats.SetRawAttribute` function. Now tests stat object access.
- **MCM.EventRoundtrip test**: Rewritten with safe pcall pattern for table-based callable API.

### Added
- **Osi.TooManyArgs regression test** (Tier 2): Validates that `Osi.GetHostCharacter('extra', 'args')` does not crash, documents the exact failure scenario (arity=1, 2 string args → NULL dereference).
- **Init timing instrumentation**: All init phases now log elapsed milliseconds — `luaL_openlibs`, `enum_registry`, `register_ext_api`, `entity_register_lua`, `input_init + overlay`, `console_cmds`, `mod_detect_enabled`, `enumerate_loaded_images`, `check_osiris_library`, `install_hooks`. Total init time logged at end.

### Resolved Issues
- **Issue #66 (Osiris dispatch) — CLOSED**: `Osi.GetHostCharacter()` returns valid GUID, 13 Osi tests pass (8 dispatch + 5 edge cases), arg clamping prevents crashes.
- **Issue #68 (MCM support) — CLOSED**: All 10 MCM compatibility tests pass — ModEvents, RegisterNetListener, NetCreateChannel, PostMessageToServer, Osiris.RegisterListener, Osiris.NewCall.

### Technical
- Test count: 125/125 (85 Tier 1 + 40 Tier 2) — all passing

---

## [v0.36.49] - 2026-02-10

**Parity:** ~94% | **Category:** Test Suite Expansion | **Issues:** #66, #68, #8

### Added
- **Assertion helpers**: AssertNotNil, AssertEquals, AssertType, AssertContains, AssertEqualsFloat, AssertGUID — loaded before all tests for consistent failure reporting
- **Osiris dispatch tests** (8 Tier 2): GetHostCharacter, MetatableIndex, IsInCombat, NonexistentSafe, CacheConsistency, GetLevel, GetHitpoints, IsAlive (Issue #66)
- **Osiris edge-case tests** (5 Tier 2): WrongArgCount, WrongArgType, NilArg, TooManyArgs, LongStringArg — crash-safety validation for malformed calls
- **MCM compatibility tests** (10 Tier 1): ModEvents namespace (Subscribe/Throw/Unsubscribe/EventRoundtrip), RegisterNetListener, NetCreateChannel, PostMessageToServer, Osiris.RegisterListener, Osiris.NewCall (Issue #68)
- **Entity Events tests** (5 Tier 2): Subscribe, OnCreate, OnDestroy, SubscribeReturnsHandle, UnsubscribeWorks
- **Stats.CreateSync** and **Stats.SetRawAttribute** tests (Tier 1)
- **Osi.MetatableExists** and **Osi.IndexReturnsFunction** tests (Tier 1)

### Fixed
- **4 vacuous tests eliminated**: Entity.HostChar, Entity.ComponentAccess, Level.GetHeightsAt, Net.Version — previously passed silently when features were broken due to `if ok and host then` guards
- **~15 additional weak tests hardened**: Json.ParseInvalid (now asserts pcall fails), Stats.Sync/GetAllFiltered (removed `if s then` guards), Types.GetComponentLayout/TypeOf/GenerateIdeHelpers (now actually call functions), IO.LoadFile/Mod.GetModManager (call + assert), Memory tests (assert expected values), all Tier 2 readiness guards (Level, Audio, Net, IMGUI, StaticData) now assert function existence AND return values

### Technical
- Test count: 93 → 125 (85 Tier 1 + 40 Tier 2)
- All new string constants stay under 4095-char ISO C99 limit
- Assertion helpers loaded via `console_cmd_test_assertions` before all test definitions
- Codex planner agent identified vacuous patterns beyond initial 4; all incorporated

---

## [v0.36.48] - 2026-02-09

**Parity:** ~94% | **Category:** Osi Command Fix + MCM Compatibility | **Issues:** #66, #68

### Fixed
- **Console commands now execute in Server context** (Issue #66): Console `luaL_dostring` was running in CLIENT context after mod loading. Windows BG3SE defaults console to SERVER via `serverContext_ = true`. Now saves/restores context around both single-line and multi-line execution.
- **Diagnostic warnings for NULL g_divCall**: If `RegisterDIVFunctions` hook never fires, Osi Call/Event/Proc types now log a warning instead of silently returning nil.
- **Context warning in Osi dispatch**: Logs when Osi.* functions are called from non-server context.

### Added
- **Ext.UI namespace** (Noesis stubs for MCM): GetRoot, RegisterType, Instantiate, IsReady, SetValue, GetValue — all return nil/false. MCM detects nil and degrades to IMGUI-only mode.
- **entity:Replicate() stub**: Community Library calls `entity:Replicate("ActionResources")` for multiplayer sync. Stub no-op with one-time log.

### Technical
- Console context fix: save/restore `LuaContext` at both `process_line()` sites (lines 512 and 569)
- `osi_dynamic_call` now warns when `callFn` is NULL for Call/SysCall/Event/Proc dispatch
- Ext.UI registered after Ext.Loca in main.c namespace setup
- entity:Replicate added to entity __index handler alongside GetAllComponents

---

## [v0.36.47] - 2026-02-09

**Parity:** ~93% | **Category:** Signal Integration Fix | **Issues:** #69

### Fixed
- **ARM64 calling convention crash** (SIGSEGV in `signal_destroy_handler+72`): `ecs::EntityRef` is a 16-byte struct (`{Handle, World*}`) passed by value on ARM64, expanding to two registers (x1=Handle, x2=World*). Our handler had 3 params and dereferenced x1 as a pointer — now correctly accepts 4 params (self, handle, world, component) and uses the handle value directly.
- **Component pointer shifted to x3**: With EntityRef occupying x1+x2, the component data pointer moves to x3. Previous code read x2 as component (actually World*).
- **Client EntityWorld offset**: Changed `OFFSET_ENTITYWORLD_IN_EOCCLIENT` from 0x1B0 (wrong, overlapped PermissionsManager) to 0x1D0 (matches Windows BG3SE struct layout).
- **Memory leak in Connection array grow path**: Old `conn_buf` not freed when Signal array was reallocated.
- **CCR validation before g_bound_world commit**: Prevents bad client world from overwriting valid server world.
- **Race safety in cleanup**: `g_lua_state` nulled before signal hook removal so handlers exit immediately if they fire during teardown.

### Technical
- Signal type corrected: `Signal<EntityRef, void*>` (by value), not `Signal<EntityRef*, void*>` (by pointer)
- Game's own handler symbol confirms: `OnComponentRemoved(ecs::EntityRef, eoc::HealthComponent&)`
- CCR range validation widened to 100–65535 (was 1000–10000)
- Confirmed via crash report register analysis: x1=handle, x2=world*, x3=component, x4=game's handler

---

## [v0.36.46] - 2026-02-09

**Parity:** ~93% | **Category:** Signal Integration | **Issues:** #69

### Added
- **Signal Integration** (Issue #69 Phase 2): Entity event subscriptions now fire automatically. `Ext.Entity.OnCreate("Health", callback)` hooks directly into the game's `ComponentCallbackRegistry` at EntityWorld+0x240.
- **Connection injection**: Injects handler Connections into the game's `Signal<EntityRef, void*>` arrays. The game's inlined `Signal::Invoke` during AddComponent/RemoveComponent naturally calls our handlers — no Dobby hook needed.
- **Lazy hook installation**: Signal hooks are only installed for component types that have active subscriptions (not all ~2709 types).
- **CCR validation**: `entity_events_bind()` validates the CCR pointer chain before enabling signal hooks; graceful fallback to no-op on failure.
- **Clean removal**: All injected Connections are removed from the game's arrays during `entity_events_cleanup()` (Lua state shutdown), preventing stale callbacks.

### Technical
- `entity_events_bind()` now called after EntityWorld + TypeId discovery during session init
- Connection structs include valid `copy_`/`move_` procs for game's Array<Connection> reallocation safety
- `g_lua_state` cached each tick in `entity_events_fire_deferred()` for signal handler access
- Runtime-verified offsets: EntityWorld+0x240 = CCR, ComponentCallbacks at +0x08/+0x20 for OnConstruct/OnDestroy

---

## [v0.36.45] - 2026-02-09

**Parity:** ~93% | **Category:** Entity Event System | **Issues:** #69

### Added
- **`Ext.Entity` Event System** (Issue #69): Real C implementation replacing Lua stubs. 11 functions now backed by `entity_events.c` (~500 lines): `Subscribe`, `OnChange`, `OnCreate`, `OnCreateDeferred`, `OnCreateOnce`, `OnCreateDeferredOnce`, `OnDestroy`, `OnDestroyDeferred`, `OnDestroyOnce`, `OnDestroyDeferredOnce`, `Unsubscribe`.
- **Subscription pool**: Salted pool (256 slots) with safe handle reuse matching Windows BG3SE `SaltedPool<ComponentHook>` pattern.
- **Per-component-type tracking**: Global hooks (all entities) and per-entity hooks, matching Windows `ComponentHooks` architecture.
- **Deferred event queue**: Events flagged as deferred are queued and fired once per tick via `entity_events_fire_deferred()`, matching Windows swap-and-process pattern.
- **One-shot subscriptions**: `ENTITY_EVENT_FLAG_ONCE` auto-unsubscribes after first fire.
- **Flexible component name resolution**: Supports both full names (`eoc::HealthComponent`) and short names (`Health`) with automatic prefix/suffix probing.

### Technical
- New files: `src/entity/entity_events.h`, `src/entity/entity_events.c`
- `entity_events_init()` called during Lua state init
- `entity_events_bind()` called when server/client EntityWorld is captured
- `entity_events_fire_deferred(L)` called each tick after event processing
- `entity_events_register_lua(L)` overwrites Ext.Entity stubs with real C functions
- Signal integration (auto-fire on component create/destroy) requires future RE of `ComponentCallbackRegistry` offset in EntityWorld — currently events are managed through the subscription layer

---

## [v0.36.44] - 2026-02-09

**Parity:** ~93% | **Category:** Review Fixes (Windows Compat) | **Issues:** #68, #69

### Fixed
- **`Ext.Utils.Version()`**: Now returns integer build number (e.g. `3644`) instead of string. Fixes mod version checks (`if Ext.Utils.Version() >= 20`).
- **`Ext.Utils.GetGameState()`**: Now returns enum string ("Running", "Paused", "LoadSession") instead of integer. Matches Windows BG3SE convention.
- **`Ext.Math.Random()`**: 1-arg and 2-arg modes now return integers matching Lua/Windows convention. `Random(10)` → `[1,10]`, `Random(5,10)` → `[5,10]`. 0-arg mode still returns float `[0,1)`.
- **`Ext.ModEvents` Unsubscribe**: Fixed ipairs hole bug where `handlers[id] = nil` broke iteration. Now uses max_id tracking with numeric for loop, safely skipping nil entries.
- **`Ext.Types.Serialize/Unserialize`**: Now logs warning about JSON fallback semantics (Windows operates on C++ proxy userdata).

### Added
- **`Ext.Utils.GameTime`**: Alias to `Ext.Timer.GameTime` (missing backward-compat alias).
- **`Ext.Utils.Round`**: Alias to `Ext.Math.Round` (missing backward-compat alias).
- **`Ext.Utils.Random`**: Alias to `Ext.Math.Random` (missing backward-compat alias).
- **`Ext.Entity` companion stubs**: `Unsubscribe`, `OnCreate`, `OnDestroy`, `OnCreateDeferred`, `OnDestroyDeferred`, `EnableTracing`, `DisableTracing`, `GetAllEntities`, `GetAllEntitiesWithComponent`, `GetAllComponents`, `GetReplicationFlags` — all log warning and return nil.

### Technical
- `lua_ext_utils_version()` parses `BG3SE_VERSION` string → `minor*100 + patch` integer.
- `lua_ext_utils_get_game_state()` calls `game_state_get_name()` to convert integer → string.
- `lua_math_random()` in `lua_math.c` uses `luaL_checkinteger` + `lua_pushinteger` for 1/2-arg modes.
- `Ext.Utils.Random/Round` aliases set after `lua_math_register()` to avoid referencing empty table.

---

## [v0.36.43] - 2026-02-09

**Parity:** ~93% | **Category:** MCM Support & Mod Compatibility | **Issues:** #68, #69

### Added
- **`Ext.Utils` namespace** (Issue #69): `Print`, `PrintWarning`, `PrintError`, `Version`, `MonotonicTime`, `GetGameState` — aliases to existing implementations. Fixes crash-on-load for Community Library, 5e Spells, and Compatibility Framework mods.
- **`Ext.RegisterNetListener(channel, callback)`** (Issue #68): Per-channel network message listener. MCM's backbone for client-server sync. Callbacks receive `(channel, payload, userId)`.
- **`Ext.ModEvents`** (Issue #68): Per-mod cross-mod event system with `:Subscribe(callback)`, `:Throw(data)`, `:Unsubscribe(id)`. MCM uses `Ext.ModEvents['BG3MCM'][name]:Throw(data)`.
- **`Ext.IMGUI.GetViewportSize()`** (Issue #68): Returns `{width, height}` of game viewport from Metal backend's `DisplaySize`. MCM uses for responsive window sizing.
- **`Ext.Utils.GetGameState()`** (Issue #68): Returns cached game state enum string (updated on every `GameStateChanged` event).
- **`Ext.Math.Random(min, max)`** (Issue #69): Integer-returning random matching Windows/Lua convention. Used by Community Library.
- **`Ext.Debug.IsDeveloperMode()`** (Issue #68): Returns `false` (stub). MCM uses for conditional loca loading.
- **`Ext.Debug.Reset()`** (Issue #68): Logs warning (stub). MCM binds this to a keybinding.
- **`Ext.Types.Serialize/Unserialize`** (Issue #69): JSON fallback with warning. Used by 5e Spells.
- **`Ext.Entity.Subscribe` + 11 companions** (Issue #69): Stubs with warnings. Used by Community Library.

### Technical
- `imgui_metal_get_viewport_size()` C wrapper in `imgui_metal_backend.mm` reads `ImGui::GetIO().DisplaySize` — callable from C files without cimgui.
- `events_get_current_game_state()` caches `toState` from `events_fire_game_state_changed()`.
- Per-channel listener registry in `lua_events.c`: Lua registry table keyed by channel name, each containing an array of callback functions. Fired before `NetModMessage`/`NetMessage` event handlers.
- `Ext.ModEvents` implemented as pure Lua using metatables for lazy initialization of mod and event tables with max_id tracking.
- Made `lua_log_print`, `lua_log_print_warning`, `lua_log_print_error` non-static for cross-module aliasing.

---

## [v0.36.42] - 2026-02-07

**Parity:** ~92% | **Category:** Mod Crash Attribution | **Issues:** #66

### Added
- **Runtime mod attribution**: Every event handler now tracks which mod registered it by parsing Lua source paths (`Mods/<ModName>/ScriptExtender/`) at subscribe time. Mod context set around every `lua_pcall` via `mod_set_current()`.
- **Per-mod health tracking**: `ModHealthEntry` tracks handlers_registered, errors_logged, events_handled, last_error, and soft_disabled per mod. Updated across all 14 `events_fire_*` functions.
- **`!mod_diag` console command**: Shows per-mod health summary, error details (`!mod_diag errors`), and soft-disable/enable (`!mod_diag disable <ModName>`, `!mod_diag enable <ModName>`).
- **Soft-disable**: Disabled mods' handlers are skipped at dispatch time without removal — re-enable restores them instantly. No restart needed for crash isolation.
- **Enhanced crash reports**: Mach exception handler now outputs active mod name and per-mod health summary (handler counts + error counts) alongside breadcrumbs and register state.
- **Breadcrumb mod context**: `BreadcrumbEntry` now carries `mod_name` field. `BREADCRUMB_MOD(id, mod)` macro for mod-aware breadcrumbs.
- **Ext.Debug.ModHealthCount()**: Returns number of tracked mods.
- **Ext.Debug.ModHealthAll()**: Returns table of all mod health entries (name, handlers, errors, handled, disabled, last_error).
- **Ext.Debug.ModDisable(mod, bool)**: Programmatic soft-disable/enable.

### Technical
- `extract_mod_name_from_lua()` walks Lua callstack via `lua_getinfo(L, "S", &ar)`, parsing `@Mods/<Name>/ScriptExtender/` patterns. Falls back to `mod_get_current_name()` (bootstrap), then "console" or "unknown".
- All 14 fire functions updated: events_fire, events_fire_tick, events_fire_game_state_changed, events_fire_key_input, events_fire_do_console_command, events_fire_lua_console_input, events_fire_turn_started, events_fire_turn_started_from_osiris, events_fire_turn_ended_from_osiris, events_fire_status_applied, events_fire_execute_functor, events_fire_after_execute_functor, events_fire_net_mod_message, events_fire_net_message, events_fire_log.
- Crash report uses async-signal-safe manual decimal formatting for Mach exception handler output.
- `MAX_MOD_HEALTH` = 128 tracked mods.

---

## [v0.36.41] - 2026-02-07

**Parity:** ~92% | **Category:** Comprehensive Test Suite | **Issues:** #67

### Added
- **Comprehensive regression test suite** (`!test`): Expanded from 8 basic assertions to 71 tests across 20 namespaces — Core, Json, Helpers, Stats, Timer, Events, Debug, Types, Enums, IO, Memory, Mod, Vars, Osi. Each test validates existence, return types, basic functionality, or no-crash guarantees.
- **In-game test suite** (`!test_ingame`): ~22 tests requiring a loaded save — Entity (GUID lookup, component access), Level (IsReady, physics scene, heights), Audio (readiness, sound objects), Net (IsHost, version), IMGUI (readiness), StaticData (types). Each test guarded by readiness checks.
- **Test filtering**: Both commands accept an optional filter argument — `!test Stats` runs only Stats.* tests.
- **Multi-string test framework**: Global `BG3SE_Tests` table with `BG3SE_AddTest(tier, name, fn)` / `BG3SE_RunTests(tier, filter)` allows tests defined across 12 separate C string variables to run together with ordered execution via `ipairs`.

### Fixed
- **`_H()` hex formatter broken**: `lua_pushfstring` does not support `%x` format specifier. Changed to `snprintf` + `lua_pushstring`.
- **`Stats.GetAllFiltered` hangs game**: `Ext.Stats.GetAll('Weapon')` is O(n^2) — iterates 15,774 stats twice (count + name lookup). Downgraded test to function existence check; underlying performance bug tracked separately.

### Technical
- 12 C string variables replace the single `console_cmd_test`, each under the ISO C99 4095-character string literal limit
- Two-tier architecture: Tier 1 (always works, client context) and Tier 2 (needs loaded save, readiness-guarded)
- API signatures verified by research agents before implementation: `Ext.Stats.Get` returns userdata (not table), `Ext.Types.TypeOf` returns table (not string), `Ext.Timer.Pause` returns boolean
- Review agents caught 1 bug before runtime: `Types.TypeOf` assertion expected string but API returns table
- **Confirmed in-game**: 71/71 Tier 1 + 22/22 Tier 2 = 93/93 all passing on v0.36.41

---

## [v0.36.40] - 2026-02-07

**Parity:** ~92% | **Category:** Mach Exception Handler | **Issues:** #66

### Added
- **Mach exception handler** (`src/core/mach_exception.c`): Catches `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` (PAC failures, SIGSEGV) and `EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION` (SIGILL) via Mach exception ports **before** CrashReporter or POSIX signal handlers fire. Writes exception type, fault address, ARM64 register state (PC, LR, SP, FP, X0-X3, X8, X16-X17), and breadcrumb trail to `crash.log`. Returns `KERN_FAILURE` so CrashReporter still generates `.ips` files.
- **MIG-generated stubs** (`src/core/mach_exc_stubs/`): Pre-generated from `mach_exc.defs` via Apple's `mig` tool — no build-time dependency on MIG.

### Fixed
- **Issue #66: `!probe_osidef` crash (SIGSEGV).** `osi_func_probe_layout()` used `safe_memory_read()` instead of `safe_memory_read_pointer()` when reading through `void **ppOsiFunctionMan`, passing the VMT pointer as `this` and causing a PAC failure. Fixed to use the correct pointer indirection pattern.

### Technical
- Listener thread (`BG3SE-ExcHandler`) runs `mach_msg()` loop with MIG-generated `mach_exc_server()` dispatch
- `task_swap_exception_ports()` atomically saves old ports (CrashReporter) for forwarding
- Three-tier crash diagnostics: Mach handler (first) → POSIX signal handler (second) → CrashReporter `.ips` (third)
- `crashlog_get_crash_fd()` accessor exposes pre-opened crash file to exception handler
- Clean shutdown via `mach_port_destruct()` + `pthread_join` + old port restoration

---

## [v0.36.39] - 2026-02-07

**Parity:** ~92% | **Category:** Osiris Handle Encoding + Crash Diagnostics | **Issues:** #66

### Fixed
- **Issue #66: funcType=0 caused dangerous query-first fallback.** All dynamically discovered Osiris functions had type hardcoded to 0 (UNKNOWN), causing the dispatcher to try Query first then Call. For Call-type functions like `AddGold`, this could corrupt arguments or SIGSEGV. Fix: read `FunctionType` directly from the game's `OsiFunctionDef` struct at offset +0x28 via safe memory APIs.
- **Issue #66: Raw funcId passed instead of encoded OsirisFunctionHandle.** Windows BG3SE packs type + funcId + Key parts into a 32-bit handle for `DivFunctions::Call/Query`. Our code was passing the raw enumeration index. Fix: read `Key[0..3]` from funcDef +0x2C, encode handle via `osi_encode_handle()`, and pass to all dispatch paths.

### Added
- **Crash-resilient logging module** (`src/core/crashlog.c`): mmap'd 16KB ring buffer (MAP_SHARED, survives SIGSEGV), SIGSEGV/SIGBUS/SIGABRT signal handler with SA_ONSTACK + sigaltstack, breadcrumb trail (32-entry lock-free ring tracking dispatch path). All signal handler code is async-signal-safe.
- **OsirisFunctionHandle encoding** (`osiris_types.h`): `osi_encode_handle()`, `osi_decode_func_id()`, `osi_decode_func_type()` inline functions matching Windows BG3SE handle layout.
- **`!probe_osidef [N]` console command:** On-demand hex dump of OsiFunctionDef structs for ARM64 offset discovery and validation.
- **Breadcrumb macros** (`BREADCRUMB()`, `BREADCRUMB_ID()`): Placed at `osi_dynamic_call`, `osiris_query_by_id`, `osiris_call_by_id` for crash forensics.

### Technical
- `CachedFunction` extended with `handle` field for pre-computed dispatch handles
- `osi_func_get_handle()` / `osi_func_cache_set_handle()` for handle lookup and storage
- Ring buffer file: `~/Library/Application Support/BG3SE/crash_ring_<pid>.bin`
- Crash report file: `~/Library/Application Support/BG3SE/crash.log`
- Crashlog registered as log callback for WARN+ on Osiris/Hooks/Core modules
- Pre-load `backtrace()` at init to avoid dyld_stub_binder deadlock in signal handler

## [v0.36.38] - 2026-02-06

**Parity:** ~92% | **Category:** Critical Osiris Crash Fix | **Issues:** #66

### Fixed
- **Issue #66: Osiris function calls crash with SIGSEGV on ARM64.** `AddGold()`, `TemplateAddTo()`, and all Osi.* calls caused hard crashes. Root cause: `InternalCall` expects `COsipParameterList*` but we were passing `OsiArgumentDesc*` (wrong struct type). Fix: hook `COsiris::RegisterDIVFunctions` to capture `DivFunctions::Call` and `DivFunctions::Query` pointers, which correctly accept `OsiArgumentDesc*`. This matches Windows BG3SE's dispatch strategy (OsirisWrappers.cpp:38).

### Technical
- Added `DivFunctions` struct, `DivCallProc` typedef to `osiris_types.h`
- New Dobby hook on `COsiris::RegisterDIVFunctions` (exported symbol at offset 0x46348 in libOsiris.dylib)
- All Osi.* dispatch paths (Query, Call, SysCall, Event, Proc, Database) now route through `g_divQuery`/`g_divCall` with `pfn_InternalQuery`/`pfn_InternalCall` as fallback
- Hook count increased from 3 to 4 (InitGame, Load, Event, RegisterDIVFunctions)

---

## [v0.36.37] - 2026-02-06

**Parity:** ~92% | **Category:** Issue #65 Diagnostics + Net Parity | **Issues:** #65, #6

### Fixed
- **Issue #65 fallback init:** Added `deferred_session_init_tick()` fallback at end of `fake_InitGame` for machines where `fake_Event` (tick loop) never fires. On affected hardware (M4 / macOS Tahoe 26.2), the game tears down the session before Osiris events flow, so tick-based deferred init never runs.

### Added
- **`BG3SE_NO_HOOKS` diagnostic env var (Issue #65):** Set `BG3SE_NO_HOOKS=1` to skip ALL Dobby hook installation. Lua runtime remains active but Osiris/Event interception is disabled. Isolates whether inline code patching itself causes the game crash vs. other factors.
- **`bg3w.sh` env var passthrough:** Steam launch script now forwards `BG3SE_NO_HOOKS`, `BG3SE_NO_NET`, and `BG3SE_MINIMAL` environment variables to the game process.
- **Legacy `Ext.Events.NetMessage` (Issue #6):** Messages sent without a module UUID now auto-fire the legacy `NetMessage` event (Channel, Payload, UserID) in addition to `NetModMessage`. Most existing BG3SE mods use this legacy event.
- **`Ext.Net.PlayerHasExtender(userId)` (Issue #6):** Server-only function to check if a player's client has the script extender installed. Accepts userId (integer) for immediate lookup; GUID (string) returns nil pending entity component wiring.

### Technical
- `EVENT_NET_MESSAGE` added to event enum (33 → 34 events total)
- `lua_net_player_has_extender()` registered in server context only (9 functions vs 8 for client)
- Version bumped to v0.36.37

---

## [v0.36.36] - 2026-02-06

**Parity:** ~92% | **Category:** Build System | **Issues:** N/A

### Fixed
- **Build system now auto-builds all dependencies from source.** Previously, CMake linked against pre-built `.a` files (`libdobby-universal.a`, `liblua-universal.a`) that were gitignored and had no build instructions. Users who cloned the repo had no way to produce these files.

### Changed
- **Dobby** now built via `add_subdirectory(lib/Dobby)` — CMake compiles it as `dobby_static` target
- **Lua 5.4** now built as `lua_static` CMake target from source files in `lib/lua/src/`
- Removed `libdobby-universal.a` specific gitignore entry (global `*.a` pattern still covers build artifacts)
- Fresh `git clone --recursive` + `cmake .. && cmake --build .` now works with zero manual steps

---

## [v0.36.35] - 2026-02-06

**Parity:** ~92% | **Category:** Critical Bug Fix | **Issues:** #65

### Fixed
- **Game won't start with BG3SE injected (Issue #65)**
  - **Root cause 1:** Spurious `game_state_on_session_loading()` call in `fake_InitGame` (line 1876) corrupted internal state from Running→LoadSession after session was already loaded. This permanently broke deferred net init and produced misleading "bounce" in logs.
  - **Root cause 2:** ~2,800 `mach_vm_read_overwrite` kernel calls during `fake_Load` extended the timing-sensitive window after `COsiris::Load` returns, potentially triggering a game-side watchdog on some machines (especially macOS Tahoe 26.2 / M4).

### Changed
- **Deferred session init:** All heavy initialization (entity TypeId discovery ~2,200 calls, stats validation ~68 calls, static data capture ~400-600 calls) moved from `fake_Load` to tick loop (`fake_Event`). `fake_Load` now returns immediately after calling the original function + loading mod scripts.
- **State machine correctness:** `LoadSession → Running` transition now fires from tick loop after all subsystems are ready, not from `fake_Load` during the critical Load window.
- **Net hooks ordering:** Deferred net init now depends on deferred session init (Running state set correctly first).

### Added
- **Diagnostic timing:** Each deferred init step logs elapsed milliseconds (entity, stats, staticdata).
- **`BG3SE_MINIMAL` env var:** Set `BG3SE_MINIMAL=1` to skip all subsystem init (entity/stats/staticdata/net). Only Osiris hooks + basic Lua API remain active. Useful for isolating whether game failure is from init work or hooks themselves.

### Technical
- New `SessionInitState` state machine in `main.c` (IDLE → PENDING → COMPLETE)
- `request_deferred_session_init()` sets flag only (zero kernel calls in fake_Load)
- `deferred_session_init_tick()` runs in tick loop with per-step timing

---

## [v0.36.34] - 2026-02-06

**Parity:** ~92% | **Category:** Stats 100% Parity | **Issues:** Parity Push

  - Improved `AddAttribute` / `AddEnumerationValue` stubs with parameter validation

### Technical
- New `stats_copy_from()` and `stats_set_raw_attribute()` in stats_manager
- `functor_hooks_get_original_proc()` exposes saved original function pointers
- FunctorContext userdata type (`bg3se.FunctorContext`) for type-safe Lua bindings
- TreasureTable/TreasureCategory registered as Ext.Stats subtables

---

## [v0.36.33] - 2026-02-06

**Parity:** ~90% | **Category:** Bug Fix | **Issues:** #65

### Fixed
- **Game startup failure on some machines (Issue #65)**
  - Deferred ~65 `mach_vm_read_overwrite` kernel calls from `COsiris::Load` to tick loop
  - Network initialization now waits for Running state stability (500ms) before capture
  - State machine with exponential backoff retry (3 attempts max)
  - `BG3SE_NO_NET=1` environment variable retained as manual override
  - Root cause: kernel calls during timing-sensitive save load window caused session abort

### Technical
- New `net_hooks_request_deferred_init()` / `net_hooks_deferred_tick()` / `net_hooks_is_ready()` API
- Deferred state machine: IDLE → PENDING → CAPTURING → COMPLETE/FAILED
- Ext.Net local message bus continues working during deferred initialization

## [v0.36.32] - 2026-02-06

**Parity:** ~90% | **Category:** Stats Expansion + Level + Audio | **Issues:** Parity Push

### Added
- **Ext.Stats Expansion (12 new functions)**
  - `GetStats(type?)` — alias for GetAll, returns array of stat names
  - `SetPersistence(name, persist)` — deprecated stub with log-once warning
  - `GetStatsManager()` — raw RPGStats pointer for debug/advanced use

  - `TestSphere(pos, radius, physType, includeGroup, excludeGroup)` — sphere overlap test
  - `GetHeightsAt(x, z)` — tile height query (stub pending AiGrid offset verification)

- **Ext.Audio (13 functions) — NEW NAMESPACE**
  - `IsReady()` — check if SoundManager is available
  - `GetSoundObjectId(name)` — resolve "Global", "Music", "Listener0", etc. to ID

### Technical
- New modules: `src/level/level_manager.c`, `src/audio/audio_manager.c`
- New Lua bindings: `src/lua/lua_level.c`, `src/lua/lua_audio.c`
- Stats enum lookup uses RPGStats.ModifierValueLists CNEM at +0x08
- RPGEnumeration inherits CNamedElementManager — same CNEM access pattern
- Level manager shares LevelManager::m_ptr (0x08a3be40) with template_manager
- Audio manager accesses SoundManager via ResourceManager::m_ptr chain
- Physics raycasting via PhysicsScene VMT dispatch (indices need runtime verification)
- All ARM64 struct offsets are best-effort from Windows analysis; runtime RE session needed to verify

---

## [v0.36.31] - 2026-02-06

**Parity:** ~88% | **Category:** Network Handshake | **Issues:** #6

### Added
- **NetChannel API Phase 4I: ClientConnect Handshake + Version Negotiation**
  - JSON-based hello handshake: client sends `{"t":"hello","v":2}` after protocol insertion, server replies
  - `peer_manager_can_send_extender()` — gates all RakNet sends on handshake completion (proto_version > 0)
  - `Ext.Net.IsReady()` — Lua API to check if handshake is complete (server: always true, client: after hello exchange)
  - `Ext.Net.PeerVersion(userId)` — Lua API to query a peer's negotiated protocol version
  - Hello message parsing in `extender_process_msg()` — intercepts `{"t":"hello","v":N}` before routing to message bus
  - Server auto-replies to hello messages from clients
  - Host peer marked as handshake-complete on protocol insertion

### Fixed
- **ProtocolList offset corrected** — changed from `+0x2E0` to `+0x2D0`, and capacity/size fields from `uint64_t` at 16-byte stride to packed `uint32_t` at 4-byte stride. Fixes protocol insertion failing silently on all game versions. Discovered via runtime probing (45 protocols, cap=64).
- **Phase 4H critical: auto-switch timing** — moved `network_backend_set_raknet()` from `net_hooks_capture_peer()` to end of `net_hooks_insert_protocol()`, preventing message loss in the gap before protocol insertion
- **Phase 4H: hash container warning** — `net_hooks_sync_active_peers()` now logs a warning (once) when 0 of N peer IDs pass sanity check
- **Hello ping-pong prevention** — only reply to a peer's first hello (check `proto_version == 0` before replying)
- **Buffer overread in hello parsing** — `is_hello_message()` and `parse_hello_version()` now copy payload to NUL-terminated stack buffer before `strstr`/`sscanf`
- **Race condition** — `network_backend_set_raknet()` now runs before setting host peer proto_version, preventing wrong backend routing

### Technical
- `send_client_hello()` and `send_hello_reply()` bypass `raknet_send()` gating (use `net_hooks_send_message()` directly)
- `broadcast_visitor()` skips peers with `proto_version == 0`
- Implicit handshake (Phase 4H) preserved: any ExtenderMessage receipt sets `PROTO_VERSION_CURRENT`
- Ext.Net namespace now has 8 functions (added IsReady, PeerVersion)
- Added `safe_memory_write_u32()` to safe_memory API
- Larian Array layout confirmed: `{data_ptr(8), capacity_u32(4), size_u32(4)}` = 16 bytes

---

## [v0.36.30] - 2026-02-06

**Parity:** ~88% | **Category:** Network Multiplayer | **Issues:** #6

### Added
- **NetChannel API Phase 4H: Peer Resolution + Broadcast + Auto-Detect** - Completes RakNet backend for actual multiplayer
  - `peer_manager_iterate()` — callback-based iteration over all active peers
  - `peer_manager_find_by_guid()` — GUID-to-user_id lookup for `SendToClient`
  - `raknet_send_to_client()` — resolves character GUID to peer ID via PeerManager, then sends via GameServer VMT
  - `raknet_broadcast()` — iterates all non-host peers via PeerManager, sends to each (skips host + excluded character)
  - `net_hooks_sync_active_peers()` — reads GameServer ActivePeerIds array (+0x650/+0x65c) and syncs into PeerManager
  - Auto-switch to RakNet backend when GameServer is captured in `net_hooks_capture_peer()`
  - Implicit peer handshake — unknown peers auto-registered on first ExtenderMessage receipt in `extender_process_msg()`

### Technical
- `OFFSET_GAMESERVER_ACTIVE_PEERS = 0x650`, `OFFSET_GAMESERVER_ACTIVE_PEERS_COUNT = 0x65c` in protocol.h
- `PeerIterator` callback typedef and `broadcast_visitor` pattern for safe peer iteration
- ActivePeerIds sync called before broadcast to ensure PeerManager coverage
- Fallback: if ActivePeerIds is a hash container (not flat array), implicit registration provides coverage

---

## [v0.36.29] - 2026-02-06

**Parity:** ~88% | **Category:** Network Transport | **Issues:** #6

### Added
- **NetChannel API Phase 4G: Bidirectional Message Transport** - Real payload I/O via BitstreamSerializer VMT dispatch + outbound send via GameServer
  - `em_serialize` replaced diagnostic stub with real WriteBytes/ReadBytes via BitstreamSerializer VMT
  - BitstreamSerializer layout: VMT at +0x00, IsWriting (uint32) at +0x08, Bitstream* at +0x10
  - Itanium ABI VMT dispatch: WriteBytes at VMT[3], ReadBytes at VMT[4] (shifted from MSVC by +1 destructor)
  - One-time diagnostic logging on first serialize call for runtime verification
  - All VMT calls use `safe_memory_read_pointer` for crash safety
- **Outbound Send via GameServer VMT** - `net_hooks_send_message()` sends ExtenderMessages to peers
  - SendToPeer at VMT index 28 (Itanium ABI = MSVC index 27 + 1)
  - Runtime VMT probe validates function pointer before first call
  - Signature: `void (*)(AbstractPeer* this, int32_t* peerId, void* msg)` — peerId by pointer (ARM64)
  - Diagnostic logging of VMT entries around SendToPeer index for verification
- **RakNet Backend Implementation** - Full backend for real multiplayer message transport
  - JSON wire format: `{"c":"channel","m":"module","p":payload,"r":request_id,"b":binary}`
  - `raknet_send_to_server()` — client sends to peer 0 (server)
  - `raknet_send_to_user()` — server sends to specific peer by ID
  - `raknet_send_to_client()` — falls back to local (GUID resolution deferred)
  - `raknet_broadcast()` — falls back to local (peer iteration deferred)
  - `network_backend_set_raknet()` — auto-switches when GameServer is captured
  - ExtenderMessage pool allocation with controlled lifetime (pool slot intentionally held during transport)

### Technical
- `VMT_IDX_SEND_TO_PEER = 28`, `VMT_IDX_SEND_TO_MULTIPLE_PEERS = 32`, `VMT_IDX_CLIENT_SEND = 33` in protocol.h
- `OFFSET_SERIALIZER_ISWRITING = 0x08`, `VMT_IDX_WRITEBYTES = 3`, `VMT_IDX_READBYTES = 4` in protocol.h
- `net_hooks_send_message()` and `net_hooks_get_game_server()` added to net_hooks public API
- RakNet backend uses `extender_message_pool_get()` for zero-malloc send path
- Pool slots intentionally leaked during transport (game holds reference); reclamation deferred to post-send hook

---

## [v0.36.28] - 2026-02-06

**Parity:** ~88% | **Category:** Network Hooks | **Issues:** #6

### Added
- **NetChannel API Phase 4F: GetMessage Hook** - Dobby hook on `NetMessageFactory::GetMessage` intercepts message ID 400
  - ASLR-aware address resolution from Ghidra virtual address `0x1063d5998`
  - For ID 400 returns pooled ExtenderMessage; all other IDs pass through to original
  - Pre-allocated pool of 8 ExtenderMessages avoids malloc in the hot path
  - Pool falls back to heap allocation when exhausted
- **ExtenderMessage full layout** - MessageBase expanded to 40 bytes matching Windows `net::Message`
  - Added: priority, ordering_sequence, timestamped, timestamp, original_size, latency fields
  - `init_message_base()` helper initializes all fields with correct defaults
- **em_serialize diagnostic** - Dumps first 64 bytes of BitstreamSerializer for layout discovery
  - Probes candidate IsWriting offsets (0x08, 0x10, 0x18)
  - Enables runtime discovery of serializer fields without Ghidra
- **ExtenderProtocol process_msg routing** - Incoming ID 400 messages routed to message_bus
  - Extracts sender user_id from MessageContext
  - Rate-limited via `message_bus_queue_from_peer()`
  - Returns messages to pool after processing

### Technical
- `ADDR_GETMESSAGE` constant in protocol.h for Ghidra address management
- `get_runtime_addr()` helper follows established ASLR pattern from functor_hooks.c
- GetMessage hook state cleared during `net_hooks_remove()` for safe shutdown

---

## [v0.36.27] - 2026-02-05

**Parity:** ~88% | **Category:** Network Integration | **Issues:** #6

### Added
- **NetChannel API Phase 4E: Live ProtocolList Insertion** - ExtenderProtocol now injected into the game's dispatch chain
  - `net_hooks_insert_protocol()` performs insert_at(0) swap pattern into ProtocolList array
  - Idempotency guard prevents double-insertion on repeated COsiris::Event calls
  - Array growth with `malloc` fallback when capacity is full (one-time ~64 byte leak of game buffer)
  - ARM64 memory barriers (`__sync_synchronize`) ensure write ordering for concurrent readers
  - Post-insertion verification reads back data[0] to confirm
- **MessageFactory Runtime Probe** - Diagnostic probing of NetMessageFactory layout
  - Probes 32-bit and 64-bit pool array candidate layouts
  - Validates pool entries by sampling first 4 vtable pointers
  - Reports whether message ID 400 is within pool range (actual registration deferred to Phase 4F)
- **Safe Memory Write API** - `safe_memory_write()`, `safe_memory_write_pointer()`, `safe_memory_write_u64()`
  - Validates destination via `mach_vm_region`, uses `mach_vm_protect` fallback for read-only pages
  - GPU carveout region guard prevents writes to device memory

### Changed
- `net_hooks_remove()` now removes ExtenderProtocol from ProtocolList (swap-with-last pattern)
- `bg3se_cleanup()` calls `net_hooks_remove()` before ImGui/Lua shutdown
- Console Enter key bug fixed (Issue #65) — removed `insertNewline:` interception in overlay

### Technical
- ExtenderMessage vtable updated to Itanium ABI (dual destructor + preamble block)
- ProtocolList probe offsets corrected to match NETWORKING.md (+0x2E0/+0x2F0/+0x300)
- All raw pointer dereferences in net_hooks.c replaced with safe_memory API

---

## [v0.36.26] - 2026-02-05

**Parity:** ~88% | **Category:** Network RE | **Issues:** #6

### Added
- **NetChannel API Phase 4D: Ghidra RE Complete** - All network offsets verified via statistical binary analysis
  - `EocServer+0xA8 = GameServer*` — Confirmed (233 accesses across 2706 singleton loads)
  - `GameServer+0x1F8 = NetMessageFactory*` — Confirmed (74 accesses, +16 shift from Windows)
  - `GameServer+0x2E0 = ProtocolList` — Confirmed (data/capacity/size at +0x2E0/+0x2F0/+0x300)
  - `GameServer+0x310 = ProtocolMap` — Confirmed (HashMap for protocol ID lookup)
- **Itanium C++ ABI Vtable** — Correct dual-destructor vtable layout for macOS ARM64
  - `ProtocolVtableBlock` with preamble (offset_to_top=0, typeinfo=NULL) + 8 function pointers

- **Runtime ProtocolList Probing** — Tries 3 candidate array layouts at capture time
  - Validates entries by checking for vtable-like pointer at offset 0
  - Falls back to hex dump of GameServer+0x2D0..0x320 for manual analysis
- **Network Pointer Capture Pipeline** — `net_hooks_capture_peer()` reads pointers from live game
  - Captures GameServer, NetMessageFactory, and ProtocolList from EocServer
  - Integrated into main.c after EntityWorld discovery
- **RE Scripts** — `scripts/re/find_dispatch.py`, `find_processmsg.py` for binary analysis

### Technical
- `entity_get_eoc_server()` accessor added to entity_system for cross-module access
- Message dispatch: AbstractPeer iterates ProtocolList calling ProcessMsg virtual — no hooking needed
- `NetMessageFactory::GetMessage` at `0x1063d5998` (524 callers in binary)
- Windows→macOS offset shifts: +16 (NetMessageFactory), +48 (ProtocolList) due to pthread_mutex_t growth

---

## [v0.36.25] - 2026-02-04

---

## [v0.36.24] - 2026-02-04

**Parity:** ~88% | **Category:** Network API | **Issues:** #6

### Added
- **NetChannel API Phase 2 Complete** - Request/reply callbacks now working!
  - `channel:SetRequestHandler(fn)` - Register handler that returns response data
  - `channel:RequestToServer(data, callback)` - Send request with reply callback
  - `channel:RequestToClient(data, user, callback)` - Server to client with callback
  - Callbacks are one-shot (automatically cleaned up after invocation)
  - 30-second timeout cleanup for stale callbacks

### Fixed
- **Critical: Lua state mismatch in callback invocation** - Three-agent review identified bug where `callback_registry_retrieve()` switched to `owner_L` internally but didn't return it to caller
  - Added `out_L` parameter to return actual Lua state used
  - `callback_registry_invoke()` now uses the correct state for stack operations
  - Prevents stack corruption when owner_L != L

- **JSON double-parsing error** - Callbacks received "bad argument #1 to 'Parse' (string expected, got table)"
  - Root cause: C code parsed JSON into table, but Lua wrapper tried to parse again
  - Fix: Pass raw JSON string to callbacks (matches Windows BG3SE behavior)

### Technical
- `callback_registry_retrieve(L, request_id, &out_L)` - Returns actual owner state via out parameter
- `callback_registry_invoke(L, request_id, payload, user_id)` - Full callback invocation with state safety
- `callback_registry_cleanup_for_state(L)` - Clean up callbacks when Lua state is destroyed
- Added owner tracking (`owner_L`) in CallbackEntry for cross-state safety
- Callbacks receive: `(payload_string, binary_flag)` - consistent with Windows BG3SE

### Verified
```
=== PHASE 2 FINAL TEST ===
Request sent, waiting for callback...
Server received: {"message":"Hello Phase 2!"}
*** CALLBACK SUCCESS! ***
Response: {"status":"ok","echo":"Hello Phase 2!"}
```

## [v0.36.19] - 2025-12-31

**Parity:** ~83% | **Category:** ImGui Input | **Issues:** #36

### Fixed
- **ImGui Mouse Input Complete** - Full mouse input now working (hover, click, drag)
  - **Root cause:** `ImGui_ImplOSX_NewFrame()` was overwriting CGEventTap mouse coordinates
  - **Fix:** Skip OSX backend NewFrame, use only CGEventTap for mouse position
  - Cache CGEventTap mouse position and apply directly to `io.MousePos` before `NewFrame()`
  - Hover detection (`WantCaptureMouse`) now works correctly
  - Button clicks register properly

### Technical
- Removed call to `ImGui_ImplOSX_NewFrame(view)` which was interfering with input
- Added `s_cgevent_mouse` cache to store last known CGEventTap coordinates

- Added debug display: DisplaySize, WinPos, Size in overlay for troubleshooting

---

## [v0.36.18] - 2025-12-30

**Parity:** ~83% | **Category:** ImGui Input | **Issues:** #36

### Fixed
- **ImGui Mouse Input** - Fixed coordinate conversion for macOS Cocoa games
  - Removed broken fullscreen special case that passed CG coords directly
  - Implemented proper 4-step Cocoa coordinate conversion (CG → Screen → Window → View)
  - Restored position update in click handler (was missing, causing stale positions)
  - CGEventTap mouse moves now forwarded to ImGui backend
  - Works correctly in both fullscreen and windowed modes

### Technical
- **Key Discovery:** BG3 macOS uses native Cocoa/AppKit, NOT SDL (unlike Windows)
  - Windows BG3SE hooks `SDL_PollEvent` via Detours - this approach doesn't apply
  - macOS requires CGEventTap + proper Cocoa coordinate system conversion
- Modified `convert_screen_to_window()` in `imgui_metal_backend.mm`:
  - Step 1: CG (top-left origin) → Cocoa screen (bottom-left origin)
  - Step 2: Screen coords → Window coords via `convertPointFromScreen:`
  - Step 3: Window coords → View coords via `convertPoint:fromView:`
  - Step 4: Flip Y for ImGui if view not flipped
- Added debug logging every 120th conversion to verify coordinate chain
- Updated `plans/fix-imgui-mouse-input.md` with complete implementation details
- Updated `agent_docs/architecture.md` with ImGui overlay system documentation

  - `Ext.Events.TurnEnded:Subscribe()` now works
  - Events bridged from Osiris callbacks with `CharacterGuid` field
  - Provides Events API features: priority ordering, Once flag, handler IDs

### Technical
- Added `events_fire_turn_started_from_osiris()` and `events_fire_turn_ended_from_osiris()` in lua_events.c

---

## [v0.36.12] - 2025-12-26

**Parity:** ~80% | **Category:** Logging Infrastructure | **Issues:** #8 (partial)

### Added
- **Session-Based Logging** - Each game session creates a new timestamped log file

  - Both events provide character GUID as argument
  - Note: Only fire in combat, not in force turn-based exploration

### Technical
- Session logs prevent single log file from growing indefinitely
- OneFrame pool access code runs correctly (returns 0 in client context - server EntityWorld needed for esv:: components)
- Ext.Log API verified working with module-aware logging

---

  | `eoc::combat::DelayedFanfareComponent` | 1 byte | Marker component |

### Technical
- **Two-Tier Registration**: Verified layouts register first (from `g_AllComponentLayouts`), then generated layouts (from `g_GeneratedComponentLayouts`) fill gaps - verified layouts take precedence
- **Gen_ Prefix Strategy**: All auto-generated symbols use `Gen_` prefix to avoid redefinition conflicts with 42 overlapping hand-verified layouts
- **Component Categories Discovered**:
  - Marker components (1 byte): Presence IS the data (boolean tags)
  - Container components (16-64 bytes): Hash tables, dynamic arrays
  - Data components (4-160 bytes): Game state storage
- **ARM64 vs Windows**: Sizes may differ due to alignment/packing differences
- **Automated workflow**: TypeId extraction → Header parsing → Size verification → Integration

### Files Added/Modified
- `src/entity/generated_typeids.h` - 1,999 TypeId address macros
- `src/entity/generated_property_defs.h` - 504 property definitions with `Gen_` prefix
- `src/entity/component_property.c` - Two-tier registration, MAX_COMPONENT_LAYOUTS=1024

## [v0.36.4] - 2025-12-22

**Parity:** ~76% | **Category:** Context System | **Issues:** #15

### Added
- **Client/Server Context Separation** - Lua execution context awareness
  - `Ext.GetContext()` - Returns "Server", "Client", or "None"
  - `Ext.IsServer()` / `Ext.IsClient()` - Now return real context state (were hardcoded stubs)
  - Context transitions through lifecycle: None → Server (BootstrapServer.lua) → Client (BootstrapClient.lua)

- **Context-Aware Bootstrap Loading** - Proper two-phase mod initialization
  - Phase 1: All BootstrapServer.lua files load in SERVER context
  - Phase 2: All BootstrapClient.lua files load in CLIENT context
  - Matches Windows BG3SE single-player behavior

- **Context Guards for Server-Only APIs**
  - Ext.Osiris operations: RegisterListener, NewCall, NewQuery, NewEvent, RaiseEvent
  - Ext.Stats write operations: SetProperty, Create, Sync
  - Guards log warnings (not errors) for backward compatibility

### Technical
- **Architecture Decision**: Single Lua state with context flag (not dual states)
  - BG3 macOS is single-player where server/client run in same process
  - Simpler to maintain while matching Windows BG3SE behavior
- **New module**: `src/lua/lua_context.c/h` - Context management
  - `LuaContext` enum: NONE, SERVER, CLIENT
  - Thread-safe static state with logging on transitions
- **Context detection**: Based on bootstrap loading phase, not runtime hooks

### Files Modified

## [v0.36.3] - 2025-12-22

**Parity:** ~75% | **Category:** StaticData | **Issues:** #45

### Added
- **All 9 StaticData types now working** - Complete expansion from Feat-only to full coverage
  - Background: 22 entries
  - Class: 70 entries
  - Origin: 27 entries
  - Progression: 1004 entries
  - ActionResource: 87 entries
  - Feat: 41 entries
  - Race: 156 entries
  - God: 24 entries
  - FeatDescription: 41 entries

- **Ext.StaticData.ForceCapture()** - Triggers manager capture without character creation
  - Calls Get<T> functions directly using captured ImmutableDataHeadmaster
  - Also performs hash lookup for types without Get<T> hooks

- **Ext.StaticData.HashLookup()** - Hash table lookup for remaining types
  - Uses type index from TypeContext to look up managers in ImmutableDataHeadmaster
  - Enables Race, God, FeatDescription, Feat capture

### Technical
- **Root cause identified**: TypeContext stores TYPE INDEX SLOTS (metadata), not actual manager instances
- **Dual capture strategy**:
  1. Get<T> hooks capture Background, Class, Origin, Progression, ActionResource automatically
  2. Hash lookup captures Race, God, FeatDescription, Feat via type index
- **ImmutableDataHeadmaster hash table structure** (from Ghidra decompilation):
  - `+0x00`: buckets array (uint32_t*)
  - `+0x08`: bucket_count (int32_t)
  - `+0x10`: next chain array (uint32_t*)
  - `+0x20`: keys array (int32_t*) - type indices
  - `+0x2c`: size (int32_t)
  - `+0x30`: values array (void**) - manager pointers
- **Get<T> function offsets**:
  - `Get<BackgroundManager>`: 0x02994834
  - `Get<OriginManager>`: 0x0341c42c
  - `Get<ClassDescriptions>`: 0x0262f184
  - `Get<ProgressionManager>`: 0x03697f0c
  - `Get<ActionResourceTypes>`: 0x011a4494

### Files Modified
- `src/staticdata/staticdata_manager.c` - Get<T> hooks, ForceCapture, hash lookup
- `src/staticdata/staticdata_manager.h` - New function declarations
- `src/lua/lua_staticdata.c` - ForceCapture and HashLookup Lua bindings
- `ghidra/offsets/STATICDATA.md` - TypeContext vs Manager discovery documentation
- `plans/fix-staticdata-memory-access.md` - Investigation and fix plan

## [v0.36.2] - 2025-12-21

**Parity:** ~73% | **Category:** Resource System | **Issues:** #41

### Added
- **Ext.Resource API** - Access to non-GUID game resources (Visual, Material, Texture, etc.)
  - `Ext.Resource.IsReady()` - Returns true when ResourceManager is available
  - `Ext.Resource.GetTypes()` - Returns all 34 resource type names
  - `Ext.Resource.GetCount(type)` - Returns count for a resource type
  - `Ext.Resource.GetAll(type)` - Returns all resources of a type
  - `Ext.Resource.Get(id, type)` - Get specific resource by FixedString ID

### Technical
- **Global pointer offset:** `ls::ResourceManager::m_ptr` at `0x08a8f070`
- **ResourceBank offsets:**
  - Primary bank at ResourceManager `+0x28`
  - Secondary bank at ResourceManager `+0x30`
- **ResourceContainer structure:**
  - Bank array at `+0x08` (indexed by type * 8)
  - Bucket count at `+0x08` within each bank
  - Bucket array at `+0x10`
- **Hash table traversal** for resource iteration
- **34 ResourceBankType values:** Visual, VisualSet, Animation, AnimationSet, Texture, Material, Physics, Effect, Script, Sound, Lighting, Atmosphere, AnimationBlueprint, MeshProxy, MaterialSet, BlendSpace, FCurve, Timeline, Dialog, VoiceBark, TileSet, IKRig, Skeleton, VirtualTexture, TerrainBrush, ColorList, CharacterVisual, MaterialPreset, SkinPreset, ClothCollider, DiffusionProfile, LightCookie, TimelineScene, SkeletonMirrorTable

### Bug Fix
- Fixed Lua stack index bug in `lua_resource_register()` - relative index must be converted to absolute before pushing new tables

### Files Added
- `src/resource/resource_manager.c` - Core resource manager implementation
- `src/resource/resource_manager.h` - Header with ResourceBankType enum
- `src/lua/lua_resource.c` - Lua bindings for Ext.Resource
- `src/lua/lua_resource.h` - Header
- `ghidra/offsets/RESOURCE.md` - Offset documentation

## [v0.36.1] - 2025-12-21

**Parity:** ~72% | **Category:** Template System | **Issues:** #41

### Added
- **Template Auto-Capture** - Templates now captured automatically via direct global pointer reads (no hooks needed)
  - `Ext.Template.IsReady()` - Returns true after lazy initialization
  - `Ext.Template.GetCount("Cache")` - Returns 61 templates
  - `Ext.Template.GetCount("LocalCache")` - Returns 19 templates
  - `Ext.Template.GetAllCacheTemplates()` - Iterate all cached templates with GUIDs
  - `Ext.Template.GetAllLocalCacheTemplates()` - Iterate local cache templates

### Technical
- **Global pointer offsets discovered via Ghidra:**
  - `GlobalTemplateManager::m_ptr` at `0x08a88508`
  - `CacheTemplateManager::m_ptr` at `0x08a309a8`
  - `Level::s_CacheTemplateManager` at `0x08a735d8`
- **CacheTemplateManagerBase structure:**
  - Value array (template pointers) at offset `+0x80`
  - Template count at offset `+0x98`
- **GameObjectTemplate GUID** at offset `+0x10` is a FixedString index, resolved via `fixed_string_resolve()`
- **Vtable validation** prevents crashes from invalid template pointers
- **Lazy initialization** - Global pointers are NULL at startup, retry on first API access

### Why Hooks Failed
ARM64 ADRP instruction at offset +0xC in `GetTemplateRaw` leaves only 8 bytes of safe prologue space (need 16 for absolute branch). Solution: Read singleton pointers directly instead of hooking.

### Files Modified
- `src/template/template_manager.c` - Global pointer offsets, iteration, GUID fix
- `src/lua/lua_template.c` - Simplified template-to-Lua conversion
- `ghidra/offsets/TEMPLATE.md` - Comprehensive structure documentation

---

## [v0.36.0] - 2025-12-20

**Parity:** ~72% | **Category:** Template System | **Issues:** #41

### Added
- **Ext.Template API Expansion** - Expanded from 12 to 14 functions with full property access
  - `GetAllLocalCacheTemplates()` - Returns templates from LocalCacheTemplates manager
  - `GetAllLocalTemplates()` - Returns templates from LocalTemplateManager

- **Template Property Expansion** - Templates now expose 10 properties (up from 4)
  | Property | Type | Description |
  |----------|------|-------------|
  | Guid | string | Template GUID |
  | TemplateId | string | Resolved template ID |
  | TemplateName | string | Resolved template name |
  | ParentTemplateId | string | Resolved parent template ID |
  | Type | string | Template type (Character, Item, etc.) |
  | RawType | string | Raw type from virtual function |
  | TemplateIdFs | integer | FixedString index for ID |
  | TemplateNameFs | integer | FixedString index for name |
  | ParentTemplateIdFs | integer | FixedString index for parent |
  | Handle | integer | Runtime template handle |

- **Template Type Detection** - `GetType()` now returns proper type names via virtual function call
  - Supported types: Character, Item, Scenery, Surface, Projectile, Decal, Trigger, Prefab, Light
  - Falls back to "Unknown" only for truly unrecognized types

### Technical
- Virtual function call for type detection: VMT[3] is GetType() on ARM64
- FixedString resolution via `fixed_string_resolve()` for string properties
- Safe memory reads with bounds checking for all property access
- Added `template_get_type_string()` for raw type access via virtual call

### Usage Example
```lua
-- Get a template with full properties
local tmpl = Ext.Template.Get("your-template-guid")
if tmpl then
    _P("Template: " .. (tmpl.TemplateName or "unnamed"))
    _P("Type: " .. tmpl.Type)
    _P("Parent: " .. (tmpl.ParentTemplateId or "none"))
end

-- Enumerate all local cache templates
for i, t in ipairs(Ext.Template.GetAllLocalCacheTemplates()) do
    _P(i .. ": " .. t.Guid .. " (" .. t.Type .. ")")
end
```

## [v0.35.0] - 2025-12-20

**Parity:** ~70% | **Category:** Entity Components | **Issues:** #33

### Added
- **Dynamic Array Support for Components** - Components with `Array<T>` fields now expose iterable Lua arrays
  - `entity.Tag.Tags` - Array of 16-byte GUIDs (category tags on entities)
  - `entity.Classes.Classes` - Array of ClassInfo with `ClassUUID`, `SubClassUUID`, `Level`
  - `entity.PassiveContainer.Passives` - Array of EntityHandle references
  - `entity.SpellBook.Spells` - Array of SpellData (88 bytes) with `SpellId`

  - `__index` - Access elements with 1-based indexing `array[1]`
  - `__pairs` / `__ipairs` - Standard Lua iteration
  - `__tostring` - Debug output `Array[22](0x12345678)`

- **New Element Types** for array marshaling:
  - `ELEM_TYPE_CLASS_INFO` - ClassInfo struct (40 bytes: 2× GUID + Level)
  - `ELEM_TYPE_BOOST_ENTRY` - BoostEntry struct (24 bytes: BoostType + nested Array)

### Technical
- `FIELD_TYPE_DYNAMIC_ARRAY` - New field type in ComponentPropertyDef
- `ArrayElementType` enum categorizes element types for proper marshaling
- Array memory layout: `buf_` (8 bytes) + `capacity_` (4 bytes) + `size_` (4 bytes)
- Safe memory reads with bounds checking and lifetime validation
- Element-specific field extraction (ClassUUID, SubClassUUID, Level, BoostType, etc.)

### Usage Example
```lua
local player = Ext.Entity.Get(GetHostCharacter())

-- Iterate tags
for i, tag in ipairs(player.Tag.Tags) do
    _P("Tag: " .. tag)  -- Prints GUID string
end

-- Access class info
for i, class in ipairs(player.Classes.Classes) do
    _P("Class: " .. class.ClassUUID .. " Level: " .. class.Level)
end

-- Check boost types
for i, boost in ipairs(player.BoostsContainer.Boosts) do
    _P("Boost Type " .. boost.Type .. " has " .. boost.BoostCount .. " entries")
end
```

## [v0.34.2] - 2025-12-20

**Parity:** ~68% | **Category:** StaticData | **Issues:** #40

### Fixed
- **Ext.StaticData.GetAll() now returns all entries** - Previously returned only 1 item, now correctly returns all feats (41 entries)
  - Root cause: `probe_for_real_manager()` searched within TypeContext metadata for wrong pattern
  - Fix: Rely on GetFeats hook to capture real FeatManager with correct structure
  - Real FeatManager uses flat array at +0x80 with count at +0x7C

### Technical
- Removed faulty probing logic from `capture_managers_via_typecontext()`
- TypeContext metadata provides type registration, not data access
- Real manager captured via hook when feat window is accessed
- Verified: GetAll, GetCount, and Get by GUID all working correctly

---

## [v0.34.1] - 2025-12-17

**Parity:** ~68% | **Category:** StaticData | **Issues:** #40

### Added
- **Auto-capture for Ext.StaticData** - Eliminates Frida requirement for basic StaticData access
  - `staticdata_post_init_capture()` - Automatic manager discovery at SessionLoaded
  - TypeContext traversal finds managers by name in ImmutableDataHeadmaster linked list
  - Real manager probing validates metadata pointers at multiple offsets
  - Frida capture as fallback if auto-capture fails
- **Ext.StaticData.TriggerCapture()** - Manual capture trigger for debugging

### Changed
- `Ext.StaticData.GetAll("Feat")` now works at main menu without Frida
- Post-init capture runs automatically after SessionLoaded event

### Technical
- Generic `looks_like_real_manager()` validates any manager type using ManagerConfig
- Generic `probe_for_real_manager()` searches metadata at offsets 0x08-0x78
- Safe memory reads via mach_vm_read prevent crashes on invalid pointers
- 3-phase capture: TypeContext → Probe metadata → Frida fallback

---

## [v0.34.0] - 2025-12-16

**Parity:** ~67% | **Category:** Hooks, StaticData | **Issues:** #44, #40

### Added
- **ARM64 Safe Hooking Infrastructure** - Complete skip-and-redirect hooking system for functions with ADRP+LDR prologues
  - `arm64_decode.h/c` - Full ARM64 instruction decoder with 20+ instruction types
  - `arm64_hook.h/c` - Safe hooking API: `arm64_safe_hook()`, `arm64_hook_at_offset()`, `arm64_unhook()`
  - `arm64_analyze_prologue()` - Detects PC-relative instruction patterns
  - Trampoline allocation within ±128MB for relative branches
- **Frida prologue analyzer** - `tools/frida/analyze_prologue.js` for runtime verification
- **ARM64_SAFE_HOOKING.md** - Comprehensive implementation documentation

### Changed
- **FeatManager::GetFeats now uses standard Dobby hook** - Frida analysis confirmed NO ADRP+LDR patterns in prologue
- `staticdata_manager.c` - Falls through to Dobby when prologue is safe (no PC-relative instructions)

### Fixed
- **Issue #40 unblocked** - StaticData can now hook FeatManager without ARM64 corruption
- Build errors: Added missing `#include <stddef.h>` and `#include <unistd.h>`
- Overlay console stability: prevent crashes when clicking overlay tabs by centralizing Lua dispatch on the tick thread (queue key events + overlay commands) and only submitting commands on Enter (not focus loss)

### Technical
- **Key Discovery**: FeatManager::GetFeats prologue is standard frame setup (STP x22,x21; STP x20,x19; STP x29,x30; ADD x29,sp,#32) - no ADRP patterns
- **ARM64 ADRP encoding**: 21-bit immediate encodes ±4GB PC-relative page offset
- **Skip-and-redirect strategy**: Hook AFTER safe instructions, let original prologue run in-place
- **Trampoline structure**: [skipped prologue] + [overwritten insn] + [branch back to target+N]

---

## [v0.33.0] - 2025-12-15

**Parity:** ~66% | **Category:** StaticData | **Issues:** #40

### Added
- **FixedString Name resolution** - Feat entries now include actual names (e.g., "Alert", "Actor", "AbilityScoreIncrease")
- **Type-specific capture loading** - `LoadFridaCapture("Race")`, `LoadFridaCapture("Origin")` etc.
- **Generic ManagerConfig infrastructure** - Per-type offsets for all resource types (Race, Origin, God, Class, Background)

### Changed
- `Ext.StaticData.GetAll("Feat")` now returns Name field in addition to ResourceUUID
- `LoadFridaCapture()` accepts optional type parameter (defaults to "Feat" for backwards compatibility)

### Technical
- **FixedString at offset +0x18** - Name field located after GuidResource base class (VMT + UUID = 24 bytes)
- **ManagerConfig struct** - Stores count_offset, array_offset, entry_size, name_offset, capture_file per type
- **Type-specific name offsets** - Race: +0x18, Origin: +0x1C, God: +0x18, Class: +0x28, Background: none (DisplayName only)

---

- **Template manager C implementation** - `src/template/template_manager.c` with Frida capture loading
- **Frida discovery script** - `tools/frida/discover_template_managers.js` for runtime template capture

### Technical
- **Same pattern as StaticData** - Frida runtime capture when symbols aren't exported
- **4-level template hierarchy** - GlobalTemplateBank → LocalTemplateManager → CacheTemplateManager → LocalCacheTemplates
- **GameObjectTemplate struct** - VMT, Tags, FixedString IDs, Handle at discovered offsets

---

## [v0.32.8] - 2025-12-15

- **No reverse engineering needed** - componentSize=0, properties=NULL
- **157 total components** - Massive jump from 52 (~8% parity for components)

---

## [v0.32.7] - 2025-12-14

**Parity:** ~60% | **Category:** Entity Components | **Issues:** #33

### Added

**Tag Components (presence = data):**
- `Avatar`, `Trader`, `CanLevelUp`, `IsGold`, `IsItem`, `IsDoor`, `IsFalling`, `IsInTurnBasedMode`, `GravityDisabled`

### Technical
- **Batch acceleration** - Tag components require no offset verification
- **52 total components** - Exceeds 50-component goal from Issue #33

---

## [v0.32.6] - 2025-12-14

**Parity:** ~58% | **Category:** Entity Components | **Issues:** #33

### Added
- **5 new component layouts** - Expanded from 36 to 41 components
  - `DeathState`, `DeathType`, `InventoryWeight`, `ThreatRange`, `IsInCombat`

---

## [v0.32.5] - 2025-12-14

**Parity:** ~57% | **Category:** Static Data, Debug API | **Issues:** #40

### Added
- **Ext.StaticData API (Foundation)** - New Lua namespace for immutable game data
- `Ext.StaticData.GetCount(type)` - Get count of entries (works for Feat: returns 37)
- `Ext.StaticData.GetTypes()` - List all supported type names

  - `Ext.Debug.ClassifyPointer(addr)` - Classify pointer type

### Known Limitations
- **GetAll() returns invalid GUIDs** - TypeContext gives registration metadata, not real manager data
- **GetFeats hooks disabled** - Hooks broke feat selection UI; root cause under investigation
- **Feat data access incomplete** - Count works (37), but individual feat entries need hook-based capture

### Technical Discoveries
- **TypeContext is metadata, not managers** - ImmutableDataHeadmaster TypeContext provides registration entries, not actual GuidResourceBank data
- **Real FeatManager structure** - count at +0x7C, array at +0x80 (from GetFeats @ `0x101b752b4`)
- **TypeContext structure** - count at +0x00, linked list pointer at +0x80 (NOT feat array)
- **m_State discovered**: ImmutableDataHeadmaster m_State at offset `0x083c4a68`
- **121 TypeInfo entries** scanned via linked list traversal

### Documentation
- Updated `agent_docs/development.md` with Debug API reference
- Updated `ghidra/offsets/STATICDATA.md` with structure findings

## [v0.32.4] - 2025-12-13

**Parity:** ~57% | **Category:** Stats System | **Issues:** #32

### Added
- **Full Stats Sync for created stats** - `Ext.Stats.Sync()` now works for both existing game stats AND newly created shadow stats
- **Shadow stat detection** - `stats_is_shadow_stat()` API for checking if a stat was created at runtime
- **FixedString interning** - `fixed_string_intern()` creates new FixedStrings via game's `ls::FixedString::Create`
- **RefMap insertion** - New prototypes can be inserted into prototype manager hash tables

### Fixed
- **SpellPrototype::Init crash** - Shadow stats now use template cloning (memcpy) instead of Init()
- **ARM64 const& calling convention** - Fixed crash by passing pointer (not value) to Init function
- **Prototype registration** - New spells properly registered with SpellPrototypeManager

### Technical
- **Shadow stats architecture**: Stats created via `Ext.Stats.Create()` exist in a separate registry, not in `RPGStats.Objects`. `Init()` can't find them, so we clone the template prototype instead.
- **SpellPrototype::Init** at `0x101f72754` - Populates prototype from stats object in RPGStats
- **FixedString::Create** at `0x1064b9ebc` - Game's function for interning new strings
- **RefMap hash** is `fs_key % capacity` (verified via Ghidra)
- **Two-path sync**: Shadow stats use memcpy clone, game stats use Init()

### Verified Working
```lua
-- Create and sync shadow spell
local spell = Ext.Stats.Create("MyTestSpell", "SpellData", "Projectile_FireBolt")
spell.Damage = "2d6"
Ext.Stats.Sync("MyTestSpell")  -- No crash, prototype registered

-- Create and sync shadow status
local status = Ext.Stats.Create("TestStatus", "StatusData", "BURNING")
Ext.Stats.Sync("TestStatus")   -- No crash, prototype registered

-- Sync existing game spell
Ext.Stats.Sync("Projectile_FireBolt")  -- Works for game stats too
```

## [v0.32.2] - 2025-12-12

**Parity:** ~55% | **Category:** Stats System | **Issues:** #32

### Added
- RefMap linear search implementation (hash function is non-trivial)
- ARM64 const& calling convention documentation

### Fixed
- **SpellPrototype::Init crash** - Fixed by passing FixedString as pointer (const& semantics)
- RefMap lookup now uses linear search after discovering hash function is proprietary

### Changed
- **`Ext.Stats.Sync()` fully working for existing spells** - Modify damage, costs, etc. and sync
- Stats modifications propagate to game prototypes without crashes

### Technical
- RefMap hash function is NOT `key % capacity` - FireBolt at FS=512753744 found in bucket 11798, not expected 7508
- ARM64 `const&` parameters must be passed as pointers: `Init(proto, &fs_key)` not `Init(proto, fs_key)`
- Linear search through ~5000 spell prototypes is sub-millisecond

### Verified Working
```lua
local spell = Ext.Stats.Get("Projectile_FireBolt")
spell.Damage = "3d10"
Ext.Stats.Sync("Projectile_FireBolt")  -- No crash, damage updated
```

- `sync_spell_prototype()` now calls SpellPrototype::Init on existing prototypes

### Changed
- **`Ext.Stats.Sync()` now functional for SpellData** - Modified spells re-sync with game

### Technical
- Discovered SpellPrototype::Init via XREFs from ParseSpellAnimations
- RefMap structure documented: +0x08 buckets, +0x10 capacity, +0x18 next, +0x28 keys, +0x38 values
- Init function reads FixedString from stats object at offset +0x20

### Limitations
- Newly created (shadow) spells need RefMap insertion (not yet implemented)
- Status/Passive/Interrupt Init functions need discovery for those types
